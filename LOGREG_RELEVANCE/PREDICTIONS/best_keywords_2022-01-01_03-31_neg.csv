Such bootlegs are rock’n’roll relics of the pre-Internet age, perhaps only valued now by collectors . The audio they contain, once highly prized and difficult to obtain, can mostly be found online .  'Trade Mark of Quality' (TMQ) label began to pump out a steady stream of concert recordings by the big rock bands of the era . TMQ’s ‘Live'r Than You'll Ever Be’, a terrific Rolling Stones live concert recording, is said to have sold over 250,000 units (enough to have earned the band a gold record) A chance meeting in a record store led to many of their releases having covers designed by William Stout, who became the pre-eminent bootleg artist of all time .  All of the big British artists of the day were bootlegged – often by outfits based abroad like TMQ . Records would be pressed abroad because the legal consequences were less significant . But, with the coming of punk, a homegrown bootleg culture really got going in the UK .  Bootlegs of forbidden music cut onto X-ray film in Cold War era Soviet Union . 'Bad Boys' has a take-off of The Beatles’ Sergeant Peppers sleeve with the original personalities swapped out for a bunch of rock’n’roll icons including Hendrix, Brian Jones, Lou Reed, Jim Morrison, Bill Hayley ."

Several forms of preservation action could be attempted to ensure a DAW session created in 2021 can still be accessed in 50 or 100 years . Each DAW application has its own session file format which generally lacks interoperability with other DAWs . All these factors present a massive digital preservation challenge .  The Turnbull Library has donated two of Luke Rowell’s master tapes to the library . The project aims to archive two of Rowell's albums . The two albums chosen were the Disasteradio album Visions from 2007, and Eyeliner's Buy Now . All files are preservable and the manifest for each track is standardised .  Technical data spreadsheets feature a forensic level of detail about every stem, including VST instruments, effects, plugins, MIDI quantisation and swing, all cross-referenced to the archived assets in the collection .  The initial ideas for the song came from this little doohickey called ChordSpace, which is a free midi generator keyboard . The idea is that we're using breakbeat architecture and a kind of a looped recording as a basis for the rhythms, and then writing something else with oneshots later .  ""SweetTynes"" is like an electric piano, but sounds more like a harp . Reverb send runs from the left general to the right channel . Preverb is run through reverb - a note - hit and then that's reversed so that you have a reverse echo .  In terms of the key, I think it's in A flat major-ish, but there are a lot of minor chords . What I don't ever really do is minor key music and that's capital S sad .  Eyeliner: ""There are a lot of ideas here. Hopefully they'll be in the right tempo map"" ""I like the two sections of these two chords,"" he says . ""I just noticed that when I hit this last chord, it sounded a lot like the end of ""Aerodynamic"" by Daft Punk""  ""Sneakers For Men"" session breakdown . Luke Rowell: ""I was trying to figure out the melody that was coming-- we can figure it out.  That became this section.  This part just started out as being a kind of sort of phantom""  The Luke Rowell Collection can be found through the Turnbull archival collections database Tiaki, as well as via the National Library website and Digital New Zealand . The Collection is arranged hierarchically, with an overarching description at the top .  Using certain DAWs or a scorewriter programme such as Sibelius, you can import MIDI and, with a little bit of tinkering, export it as sheet music . Here is ‘Pinot Noir’ from the album Buy Now: Remixes for some free inspiration .  Riccardo Ferrante, ‘Care of Born-Digital Objects’ in Lisa Elkin and Christopher A.

First up is “Tiny Dancer,” originally from EJ’s 1971 masterstroke Madman Across the Water .  ""Tiny Dancer"" is no tiny achievement in Atmos, and that’s reason enough to make it our favorite Made for Spatial Audio track of the week . The second half of “Dancer” is even more impactful in all corners, with a fine blend of Elton, strings, lead guitar, steel guitar, the choir, and Roger Pope's spot-on drumming .  Arcade Fire’s “The Lightning I” fades in to a brief full-channel cacophony preamble that gives way to a dirge-like anthem of sorts . “I’m Still Standing” is a fine reminder Elton John wasn’t going anywhere, no matter how many times the calendar turns over .  Mark Hoppus’ bass work is mostly centered before he semi-nonchalantly sings his first line, “I took her out / It was a Friday night” Travis Barker’s supportive cymbal work next enters at the left . Omar Apollo makes a strong splashdown with “Invincible,” the deeply soulful, lovelorn lead single from his upcoming full-length album .  “Invincible” is the most unexpectedly exciting new track I’ve heard this month . “I’m not invincible,” Apollo admits at one point . An all-new Spatial Audio File returns next Friday ."

The line-up this year is stunning. It includes books such as A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh, Ernest Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises . An estimated 400,000 sound recordings from before 1923 will be entering the public domain .  Copyright law gives authors important rights that encourage creativity and distribution . But it also ensures that those rights last for a “limited time,” so that when they expire, works go into the public domain . The ability to freely reimagine these works may spur a range of creativity, from the serious to the whimsical .  In 2022, experts estimate that some 400,000 sound recordings published before 1923 will enter the public domain . They will become free for all to download, remix, or use in a soundtrack . US copyright law treats musical compositions and sound recordings differently .  These recordings reintroduce us to some legendary figures such as Mamie Smith and Ethel Waters . Even on a scratchy scratchy cell recording from 100 years ago, the magic comes through the magic of these artists .  These recordings provide an aural time capsule, a way of capturing fragments of the past . They were recording at a time of legally-enforced segregation and the shameful tradition of minstrel shows .  Some of the works from 1926 will enter the public domain in 2022 . They will be joined by some of the most famous compositions from that year . The works listed above are just the tip of the iceberg . The vast majority—probably 99%—of works from 1925 are out of circulation .  Public Domain Day is January 1, 2022, when works published in 1926 are free for use without tedious or inconclusive research . Many of these works are already lost or disintegrating after 95 years of copyright terms .  Canada and New Zealand have agreed to extend their copyright terms from an already long life-plus-50 to a longer life plus-70 years . The benefits are minuscule, but economists have shown that term extension does not spur additional creativity . The term extensions not only transfer wealth to a tiny subset of rights owners, but also threaten to lock away remaining works from future creators and the public .  Only works from 1926 that were published with the authorization of the author are entering the public domain . In 2019, published works entered the US public domain for the first time since 1998 . In 2022, unpublished works from authors who died in 1951 will go into public domain in 2022 .  In 2022, the public domain will welcome the first Winnie-the-Pooh book, including the great original illustrations by E. H. Shepard . The 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act gave works published from 1923 through 1977 a 95-year term . Foreign works from 1926 and before are still copyrighted in the US until 2022 .  A series of lawsuits confirmed that state laws were of indefinite duration, scope, and validity . Sound recording rights are more limited than composition rights . You can imitate a sound recording, but you just cannot copy from the actual recording .  Millions of books published from 1926–1963 are actually in the public domain because copyright owners did not renew the rights . Efforts have been underway to unlock this “secret” public domain, but compiling a definitive list of those titles is a daunting task . As of September 2019, the HathiTrust Copyright Review Program had completed this process with 506,989 US publications ."

Be sure to check out the sponsor, Revival, below .  Creative Voice file is a relic of the Sound Blaster era of computer audio . It was often used for voice samples in many games of the era that supported the sound card . ATRAC was the compression format that made it possible for those discs to reach near CD quality in a small amount of space .  The MP2 format is less common than its later audio cousin MP3 . MP2 has traditionally been heavily used in a specialized broadcasting context . The push to digital radio is finally starting to change that, as higher-quality digital broadcasts are starting to highlight the MP2’s weaknesses .  Ogg Vorbis was released in 2000 under an open-source license . It was essentially an exotic alternative to the MP3 file, produced with open standards and without licensing fees . Windows Media Audio (WMA) was used in numerous successors to Napster and the Zune Music Store .  Ogg Vorbis secretly won the war with the MP3 without the mainstream consumer even realizing it . So know that next time you play a song on Spotify, you’re listening to the way that Ogg won the battle with MP3 . Apologies if this one upset you."

The most prolific British publisher of overseas mapping in the 20th century was the government’s Directorate of Colonial Surveys . The dominance of colonial administrative perspectives in the collection reflects the importance of mapping the colonial world .  Many maps in the collection were made for a UK audience, to inform people about the empire . They are intended to convey something of the culture and history of the places they depict .  John Hughes was born in Merthyr Tydfil in 1814, and made a name for himself in South Wales and London for being the mastermind behind several steel foundries . In 1870, he was given the opportunity by the Russian Tsar to bring his expertise to Imperial Russia . His ironworks became an industrial complex attracting workers from all over the world . Hughes hoped that the good rate of pay and consistent work would compensate for the extreme weather conditions .  Carto-Cymru will hold its annual map symposium on the 20th of May . The theme this year is ‘Mapping in Megabytes– how computer generated mapping is changing the way maps are produced, used and preserved . We have an exciting line-up of speakers, starting with our very own Jason Evans .  Dr Gethin Rees, Lead Curator of Digital Mapping at the British Library will talk about the Legal Deposit Libraries’ Map Viewer . Sally MacInnes, Head of Unique and Contemporary Content at The National Library of Wales and Dr Sarah Higgins, Senior Lecturer in Information Studies at Aberystwyth University, will discuss the issues surrounding the preservation of digital maps .  The gardens surrounding the Library are required to contribute towards the impression of formality and compliment the Grade 2* listed status of the building . Recent improvements to the gardens have included a long term vision to make them more sustainable and to encourage biodiversity . The Library has stopped buying in annual bedding, instead all annual flowers have been grown from seed .  The Library provides an exhibition each year for the St. David’s Day Prayer Breakfast in Cardiff . This special event is organised by a group of Christian members of the Senedd from different parties . Guests include members of parliaments from across Europe, church and chapel leaders .  The ‘Collecting’ exhibition gives a taste of our recent acquisitions, including archives and manuscripts, books, maps, photographs and artwork . The writers Edward Thomas, David Jones, Menna Elfyn and Eigra Lewis Roberts are among those featured . Frederick Douglass, David Lloyd George and Jill Evans from the political world are also featured .  A collection of Welsh music fanzines from the 1980s from Rhys Williams’ collection, including ‘Yn Syth o’r Rhewgell’ fanzine, April 1985 . Papers relating to the 2007 travelling exhibition, ‘Crossing Oceans: Wales, Slavery and Its Music’, the year of Women in Jazz’s 21st anniversary and the bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade . Mollie Doreen Phillips was the first woman to carry a national flag at the opening ceremony of  As part of International Women’s Day 2022 celebrations the National Library is displaying some items from the collections of Menna Elfyn, Jan Morris and Margiad Evans . The Welsh Political Archive is digitising the Welsh Political Ephemera Collection .  Wales voted to leave the Welsh Parliament in 1997, but the Yes campaign won the day . Over two weeks in January the Library’s trainee conservators, Rhydian Davies and myself, traveled to Wakefield to attend a paper conservation module at the West Yorkshire History Centre . We are half-way through the training, and here's a taste of what we learned in the first half of the module .  The next step was to learn to use the leaf casting method . It uses the concept of how paper is created in the first place, using a paper pulp to fill in the missing areas . The document is flooded, and once plugged, gravity pulls the pulp down to the places that need filling ."

He says the words I choose, alone and in combination, mean something slightly different to me than you . When you listen, what you hear is the music, Anderson says .  The only yardstick by which the result should be judged is simply that of how it sounds . There is no ""Mellow"" knob or ""Vivid"" button on the recording console . In the studio, we speak in precise, quantitative terms .  It would be very useful to know the reference monitor listening level used at the listening position by the engineer during the mastering effort, which would (arguably) be the best playback level at the consumer's listening position . In the absence of that information, a consumer listener is left guessing which playback level best represents what might have been intended in the expert mastering effort .  Some mixing and mastering engineers have a ‘default’ working level at which they make most of their mixing / mastering decisions . But it’s a very personal thing and it doesn’t mean that everybody should (even if they can) listen at the same volume .  Mix engineer is trying to make it sound that nothing has been done to the music . This is particularly (but not exclusively) the case with musics such as dub and reggae . Mixing and mastering engineers talk about clarity, warmth, depth and other subjective descriptions .  An interesting property expressed by very, very good playback - for which precious few systems qualify - is the sheer inoffensiveness of the recording . The best of them extract the musical life and soul almost regardless of the artifacts .  Pete Malinverni has produced some of the most excellent sounding grand piano playing I own on any format . I have too many LPs with poor engineering of the piano sound that makes some of them unlistenable ."

He has donated a new born-digital collection to the Turnbull Library . It includes music production files and uses digital audio workstation software . Luke has generously granted a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA licence .  Luke Disasteradio & Eyeliner's “Buy Now’s ‘Buy Now' will be released on May 27th 2021 . Luke Rowell has remastered the entire album for General MIDI . Every track on the album also has a thirty minute screencast of the sessions, with me going through all my technical and artistic decisions . The remix compilation will be available on my bandcamp for free, and any contributions will be split between the artists involved .  Digital audio workstations (DAWs) such as Pro Tools, Logic Pro and Cubase have become central to music production . DAWs have also fueled the development of new styles and genres, especially in areas such as dance music .  DAWs offer the digital equivalent of what music archives have always collected in analogue form . DAW software replicates and extends many techniques that were first developed in an analogue world, such as multitrack recording, tape editing, studio mixing and effects chains . The objective of working with Luke on the Disasteradio Project has been to develop sustainable ways to archive the information contained in his DAW productions .  A DAW session created in 2021 can still be accessed in 50 or 100 years . Preserving DAW productions enables other iterative processes to continue, such as remixes and mashups .  The Turnbull Library has donated its master tape library to the Disasteradio Project . The project aims to archive two of Luke’s albums from 2007 and 2010 . All the files are preservable and the manifest for each track is standardised across the collection .  The Luke Rowell Collection contains a forensic level of detail about every stem, including VST instruments, effects, plugins, MIDI quantisation and swing, all cross-referenced to the archived assets in the collection . The material will provide multiple avenues for researchers to investigate the “nuts and bolts” of Luke's music .  The original song was laid up against a breakbeat, which I'll unmute in a second when it comes up . The initial ideas for the song came from this little doohickey called ChordSpace, which is a free midi generator keyboard .  The idea is that we're using breakbeat architecture and a kind of a looped recording as a basis for the rhythms, and then writing something else with oneshots later . The other transition element that we can have a look at is the pre-verbs .  There are a lot of minor chords in A flat major-ish A. But what I don't ever really do is minor key music and that's capital S sad .  There's this one bass note that I really like that I haven't done with much else . It's much easier than trying to dial in something goes left 40, right 40, left 60, right 60.  And then you use another group channel to change the width of it afterwards .  ""Sneakers For Men"" is a New Jack Swing tribute to Keith Sweat and New Edition . The song title came from me scouring Amazon product categories for any kind of title . The original title was ""Urban Techno"" which was kind of an attempt at being incredibly uncool with an uncool song title .

This is me just trying to work out that climb, and where we land to.  This is a more questioning type version of that bell sound . There is a vaporwave artist called ""Haircuts For Men"" that I didn't know about.  And if I knew about them, I would have not used it as a song .  The Luke Rowell Collection can be found through the Turnbull archival collections database Tiaki, as well as via the National Library website and Digital New Zealand . The Collection is arranged hierarchically, with an overarching description at the top .  Using certain DAWs or a scorewriter programme such as Sibelius, you can import MIDI and, with a little bit of tinkering, export it as sheet music . Here is ‘Pinot Noir’ from the album Buy Now: Remixes for some free inspiration .  Riccardo Ferrante, ‘Care of Born-Digital Objects’ in Lisa Elkin and Christopher A.

Building your own collection lets you appreciate albums you otherwise would have listened to once, and never again . The most important distinction is the difference between lossless and lossy file formats .  A networked attached storage (NAS) device is a computer you hook up to your network for the purpose of storing and sharing files . Using a NAS you can run software like Plex, Jellyfin, or Navidrome to serve your music collection over the internet . In effect, you are creating your own version of streaming services like Spotify .  MicroSD cards are an excellent way to expand your device’s storage for your collection . Jellyfin and Navidrome are similar but have the advantage of both being open source . MusicBee is one of the most common recommendations for holding your collection in one application .

339,"From our most recent (and, as usual, really interesting) newsletter, an article from The Cornish National Music Archive who have recently published a fascinating set of articles on the Cornish Tea Treat which are well worth a read: 
https://t.co/FJIFaZ9vAM",0,-2.1660654455641724,0.10283948245055857,6352,https://tinyurl.com/3jceuz88,"""music archive"" -is:retweet",Cornish Tea Treats - Tea Treat Day - Cornish National Music Archive," For some folk, tea treat day started early and there were many nervous glances at the sky to check if the prayers had been answered . Planning and preparation was important to a successful day . Tables to be erected and Sunday school forms to be put in place . The tables were for the competitions, the for-sale items and, most important of all, the tea .  The procession was a part of the tea treat celebrations from the early days . It remained one of the main features across the years . Music was essential and although the brass band is embedded in our minds, tea treats pre-date their creation .  The St Austell procession was the main event of the day in the early days of the celebrations . It was expected that the band would play continuously along the route apart from a short break to change music or an occasional uphill stretch .  A search has been made for music labelled ‘tea treat music’ or some which could be considered as such . Nothing conclusive has been found and Merv Davey commented, “The dozen or so marches that I am aware of are included in Ralph Dunstan’s (1) Cornish Song Book of 1929 . Most of these tunes are now employed by ceilidh or barn dance bands .  Cornwall’s central position on the medieval sea routes created the perfect environment for cultural exchange with Europe . Carvings in Cornish churches give us a window into the musicians and their instruments . The Snail Creep is a dance for couples in a long procession of several hundred people, following the band .  The ‘Turkey Rhubarb’ shows how Cornwall’s maritime heritage can be reflected in folk tradition . At Rescorla, some players of traditional instruments have formed a “Tea Treat Band” to recreate the sound that our ancestors would have enjoyed .  Many had been formed of musicians discarded by the military following the Napoleonic Wars . Many reports of such events indicate the involvement of Volunteer DCR (Duke of Cornwall Rifle) bands . The move to exclude woodwind was gradual, by evolution rather than revolution .  An even stronger view was included in the ‘West Briton’ of the 15th August 1877 where the writer expressed his very strong views at considerable length . ‘I am Sir, yours very truly, One Who Was Disgusted ”  Teachers who see no harm in employing a band trained in a public-house are often like spoiled children . From a dance after dusk to actual immorality the passage is short, and young women in Sunday schools often fall into disgrace . Teachers, being many of them very young, ought to be under the control of a committee .  Up until the 1930s, it was usual for the band members to stand in a circle with the conductor in the middle, often also playing an instrument . In later years the players sat down to play but the wooden schoolroom forms became harder as the day progressed .  The current Covid restrictions made it impossible for a conventional recording to be made so the players individually recorded their parts which were then electronically merged to produce this sound . We are grateful to FEAST and its funders who financed the making of these videos .  During wartime, particularly the First and Second World Wars, brass bands were depleted due to players serving their country . Sadly, some of the players who went to war, never returned and many bands of the immediate post war years struggled to return to normal strength .  There were sweets (nicies as they were once called), limpets (in coastal villages) and a fruit and veg stall which always seemed to sell cherries . The cherries gave rise to the popular children’s game of, “Who can spit the cherry stone the farthest! ”  The name ‘Sherdy’ seems to have come from her selling limpets on broken pieces of china sherds . A few pennies could be won by the more successful “athletes” and these were promptly spent on the stalls and games . The sports involved the usual running races as well as the usual novelty sack races .  It is not suggested that all these games were of Cornish origin but they are remembered as having been played at Cornish tea treats . The way it was played out varied from chapel to chapel but always with the aim of giving and receiving a kiss .  The Jolly Miller was a game played at St Ives Old Cornwall Society's tea treat . Old Cornish Old Cornwall society could not put a name to it . A bat and ball game like American baseball was also played .  The Dugging Ring was written by Tom Miners, an Old Cornwall Society member from the early days, and is said to be based on Camborne tea treat at Trevu Field . The fielders had to throw the ball to the post fielder before the batsman reached there and if the post was then touched with the ball then the batman was out .  Winking was a popular tea treat game where the girls sat on a circle of chairs with a boy behind each one . A boy behind one of the chairs had to watch for the wink as he must try and restrain her .  The cups were topped up by a man with a pitcher, a sort of specialist topper upper . At Bethel it was Mick Bartlett who stoked the furnace and Billy Whale who took care of the boiling water . At St Day in the 1940s/1950s it was Walter Cann who boiled the water and Peno Knowles who wielded the pitcher .  The earliest discovered newspaper reference to these iconic tea treat buns is on the 29th August 1862 in the ‘Royal Cornwall Gazette’ The suggested weight of them varies between 10 and 16oz. They were certainly big and according to Barrie Bennetts, former reporter with the “West Briton,” they were 10” in diameter and 2” thick . For the liquid refreshment, the children brought their own cups or mugs which in many cases, were tied around their necks with a ribbon .  Many tea treats extended into the evening when the band provided a concert . It was held outside with the band perched on those infamous wooden forms . The Serpentine Dance / Walk / March / Waltz was the traditional end to the day .  The Cornish tea treats took this dance to a new level by involving several hundred people into one long line and placing a full brass band in the lead . Blackwater tea treat was a regular engagement for St Agnes Silver Band in the mid-1930s .  Ralph Dunstan (1857-1933) was an avid collector of Cornish folksongs . Following a move to London he made music, and teaching music, his life’s work . He returned to Cornwall in the mid-1920s ."

341," 's ""On Close Reading and Sound Recording"" is wonderfully attentive to several aspects of music recording and performance--lyrics, politics, performers, instruments, tape, theory, etc.--plus, a Chicago connection with Tridia Brown: https://t.co/B9TJI57r33",0,-2.1748062050463335,0.10203582418834273,3471,https://humanitiesfutures.org/papers/close-reading-sound-recording/,"""sound recording"" -is:retweet",On Close Reading and Sound Recording - Franklin Humanities Institute," Chicago soul singer Tridia Brown had a passion for listening to records, singing, and playing congas in church . At age twenty-one, Tridia went with her mother to see her estranged father, Arrow, who, by this time, had become a somewhat eccentric producer and writer of soul music . Arrow had loosely sketched out ideas for ""I’ll Never Cry for Another Boy"" on the electric organ but had yet to finish it . Tridia helped him complete the song, in part by adding an extended vamp section in which she improvised repeatedly on the song�  Tridia’s recording has four elements: a lead vocal, a guitar line, a kick drum, and a splattering of backup vocals . She riffs on the main line over and over again, improvises new couplets and finally arrives at a cathartic climax .  In a rehearsal recording, the song seems to have a coherent form . The singer's voice has a distinct tinniness, almost a sharp oboe tone that seems to contain a strange amalgam of innocence and empowered resolve .  At bottom of this melody, there is a charming imperfection: ""everybody's clown"" does not fit the declamation as well as the other lyrics . It is an inexpressive awkwardness, a formal wrinkle yet to be resolved, that indexes the provisional quality of the recording .  To spell out the lyrics and to listen to the wailing excess of her melismatic gestures is to hear Tridia at a moment of resolve and empowerment . Yet, her improvisations in the vamp themselves sound like crying—as if she were transgressing her own resolve .  Tridia’s voice is at once right there as a sensuous particularity, in our headphones, and yet also somehow difficult to comprehend . It encapsulates personal heartbreak as much as it refracts a much larger totality . Tridia claimed she co-wrote the song, and that Arrow, her father, who ran the Bandit record label and produced the recordings the label released, deceitfully took all the credit for her songwriting .  When she handed the cassette of the rehearsal over to the Numero label for the reissue, Tridia told her curators they were recovering something special . The recording will still exist as a relatively open object, ready to be filled with listeners’ unspoken desires .  Many with intermedial interests work in the fields of literature, art history, performance studies, or film and media . But beyond the mastery of various theories and methods, scholars are increasingly called upon to describe, defend, and even reformulate the core methods of humanities disciplines .  In order to clearly distinguish Tridia Brown from Arrow Brown in this essay, I will refer to them by their first names . I am indebted to Clare Koury for first bringing this inspiring recording of the Majestic Arrows to my attention . The song ""I'll Never Cry for Another Boy"" might refer to the sorrow of the 1964 Ronnettes' ballad ""Walking in the Rain""  Vernacular sources for musical analysis are particularly interesting in cases where there is an ambiguity in the musical structure that engenders debate and disagreement . Steven Rings (2016) discusses online debates about the ambiguous tonal center of Daft Punk's 2013 single ""Get Lucky"" Nathan D. Hesselink similarly discusses metrical ambiguity in Radiohead’s 2001 ""Pyramid Song"" (2013)  The author of this article is using this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License to share some of the content .

Ganid employed more than threescore learned translators in the making of this abstract of the religious doctrines of the world concerning the Deities .  “God pours rain upon the earth, he causes the sun to shine upon the sprouting grain, and he gives us the abundant harvest of the good things of this life and eternal salvation in the world to come.” “We gain knowledge from the experience of man, but we derive wisdom from the contemplation of the Highest.  We search for the Most High and then find him in our hearts.  The Most High is changeless; and he is our helper in every time of need.  When you are sick, it is the Highest who heals you.  The Kenites of Palestine salvaged much of the teachings of Melchizedek, and from these records, as preserved and modified by the Jews, Jesus and Gonid made the following selection .  ‘The Lord is gracious and full of compassion.  The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his creation; he heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.  Give thanks to God, for his mercy endures forever .  The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.  He makes me to lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside still waters . ‘The Lord is near all who call upon him in sincerity and in truth,’ says the Lord .  Buddhism came to being a great and beautiful religion without God, without a personal and universal deity . However, he did find some earlier beliefs which reflected something of the influence of the teachings of the Melchizedek missionaries who continued their work in India even to the times of Buddha .  Jesus and Ganid collected the following statements from the Buddhist literature: ‘Cheerfulness and gladness are the rewards of deeds well done and to the glory of the Immortal’  The missionaries of Melchizedek carried the teachings of the one God with them wherever they journeyed . He said: “Every act shall receive its reward. Evil results in sorrow and sin ends in pain.  Joy and happiness are the outcome of a good life .  Much of this monotheistic doctrine, together with other and previous concepts, became embodied in the subsequent teachings of Hinduism . Jesus and Ganid made the following excerpts: “He is the great god, in every way supreme.  He is the creator and controller of the universe of universes .  ‘If you will but worship me in love,’ says the Eternal, ‘I will give you the wisdom to attain me, for my worship is the virtue common to all creatures . ‘We have learned to win faith by the yearning of our hearts.  We have attained wisdom by the restraint of our senses, and by wisdom we have experienced peace in the Supreme’  Zoroaster was himself directly in contact with the descendants of the earlier Melchizedek missionaries . Their doctrine of the one God became a central teaching in the religion which he founded in Persia . Aside from Judaism, no religion of that day contained more of these teachings .  “The wise course in life is to act in consonance with the spirit of truth.  God is all-seeing, and he beholds both the evil deeds of the wicked and the good works of the righteous . “We worship the most beauteous, the bountiful Immortal, endowed with eternal light.  We worship him who made the waters, plants, animals, the earth, and the heavens .  The third group of religious believers who preserved the doctrine of one God in India were known in those days as the Suduanists . Latterly these believers have become known as followers of Jainism .  The doctrine of one God became a part of the earlier teachings of several Chinese religions . Ganid collected the teachings from the teachings of its founder, Melchizedek .  Ganid’s summary of Confucianism was: “What Heaven appoints is without error.  Truth is real and divine.  Everything originates in Heaven, and the Great Heaven makes no mistakes .  Ganid compiled a summary of the belief he had arrive at regarding God as a result of Jesus’ teaching . Ganid was in the habit of referring to such beliefs as “our religion”  The Lord our God is one Lord, and you should love him with all your mind and heart while you do your very best to love all his children as you love yourself . “We cannot search out God by knowledge, but we can know him in our hearts by personal experience.  While the Father fills the universe, he also lives in our minds and souls .  “To me he is the Almighty, the Creator, the Power, and the Mercy, but best of all, he is my spirit Father, and as his earth child 1 am sometime going forth to see him . “I am going to do my best to treat each of my fellow mortals just as I think God would like to have him treated . ”  Amazon Kindle and Paperback Editions: Jesus, from Birth to Baptism . At last I have a religion with God, a marvelous God, and he is a God of eternal salvation ."

It is designed for the seasoned meditator and those new to meditation .  OSHO Bardo is suitable for meditators and those new to meditation . Free of any cultural or religious references means it has relevance globally . It features easily understandable suggestions that reflect Osho’s vision of life and death as one continuum .  OSHO Bardo is a 45-minutes’ – long meditation . The music has been specifically composed to keep you aware and at the same time deeply relaxed . The female and male voice provides gentle guidance to help the listener maintain a state of relaxed alertness .  The author's experience of OSHO Bardo is featured here, with her permission . Maneesha recalls being dropped totally into a boundless space anchoring itself to a microscopically small something .  Osho Bardo is a contemporary version of the ancient scripture using simple but powerful words that lead to deep relaxation where we can connect with our inner center . The meditation process made available by Maneesha and Sudheer could not be improved any further .  Devarupa, who was with her partner, Chandradeva throughout his illness and dying, writes: ‘I’ve had a glimpse this morning that this life is dreamlike, and that we are consciousness.’  'Give yourself this gift of death to experience that there is no death' 'Osho Bardo really works so well for me, and I keep on enjoying it more and more' 'The space I enter, the depth and the peacefulness that set in are restorative for body-mind-soul'  The OSHO Bardo at OIMR was very intense, as well as touching . It is amazing how you have made it a meditation for the living and dying, and it feels as if it is the perfect preparation for that ultimate joyful journey .  Osho Bardo Meditation has part of my life for the last six months . I love the timing of the meditation, and how the music appears and disappears . The meditation puts me in a coma-like space that it is sometimes difficult to withdraw from .  Osho Sammasati's OSHO Bardo meditation has been downloaded by Maneesha and Sudheer P. Niet . The device is an extraordinary summary of how to prepare ourselves for the next pinnacle in our lives and receive instructions on how to move from the mind and body attachment .  Male and female voices are well-recorded and soothing to the ear and soul, making it easy to relax . The music works beautifully, and as the process unfolds there is a great flow that happens between the speakers and the music .  Osho Bardo meditation gives insight into the process of conscious relaxation and how death is the culmination of that process . Sambodhi Prem’s music is the right one for meditations .  Osho Bardo meditation is a meditation that helps people near death . The meditation has been described as 'a great meditation worthy of repeating again and again'  OSHO Bardo is a meditation and relaxation method . It is not intended to replace the services of a physician, therapist, or psychiatrist . With practice, it is possible to remain relaxed and aware in any circumstance – including actively dying .  OSHO Bardo deals in part with personal preparation for a natural death which, according to Osho, is the ultimate relaxation and let-go experience . As such some may experience fear or other emotional issues or memories . Anyone unprepared for or unwilling to deal with such issues should refrain from participating in this program ."

Building your own collection lets you appreciate albums you otherwise would have listened to once, and never again . It’s often a better way to support artists compared to streaming platforms .  Google Play Music shut down in 2020, and the iTunes Music Store is difficult to access since Apple now pushes most of its users towards Apple Music instead . There are several topics you might want to learn more about if you want to further your understanding of digital audio .  A networked attached storage (NAS) device is any computer you hook up to your network for the purpose of storing and sharing files . Using a NAS you can run software like Plex, Jellyfin or Navidrome to serve your music collection over the internet . In effect, you are creating your own private version of streaming services like Spotify .  You should be able to sync your two collections over the internet . MicroSD cards are an excellent way to expand your device’s storage for your collection . If you’re looking to listen to your collection on a PC, MusicBee is one of the most common recommendations for holding your library in one application ."

It is only for you if you are a DJ who is into DJing to discover, play and share the music you absolutely love . It isn’t for “identikit” DJs, it’s not really for you to have all the time in the world to collect music .  You need to be laser-focused on discovering new music for yourself, not just buying top 100s or tracks you hear other DJs playing . Lean heavily on pro curators – you do not have the time to listen to piles of unfiltered music .  A streaming service is going to be your number one way of finding new music . It's important to have a streaming service ‘just for you’ – don’t share it with other family members . When listening to your streaming service, you must click “like” on tracks that interest you . This lets it build great “custom” playlists for you .  Choose a podcast, radio show or mix show to listen to regularly in addition to a streaming service . BBC Sounds and Mixcloud are packed with great radio stations and mix shows . Here are some ideas for where to build listening into your busy life .  All you need to do is be ready to hit “like” on songs you like (or Shazam them in the case of radio shows) - that’s it, no real “work” yet . Set aside time every week to sit down and “just” listen to music . Buy the tracks we want to add to your collection and listen to them .  You need to be registered with at least two music stores – a specialist, and a mainstream store . Specialists include Beatport, Beatsource, Traxsource and Juno Download . The biggest mainstream stores are Amazon Music and iTunes .  Buy your new tunes and add them to your collection at the end of your shortlisting session . Locate these tunes in your download store or stores of choice, and get them downloaded to your laptop . Don’t set yourself a minimum or maximum number of new tunes – quality beats quantity or quotas .  It depends really on what you’re doing in your DJing at any given time . For instance, as I personally release a new hour-long mixtape and do an associated livestream every fortnight, with brand-new music . The important thing is that you set time aside to either listen to your bought music, or – probably more fun – DJ with it at home .  Phil Morse is the founder of Digital DJ Tips . His DJ career has taken him from a 15-year residency in Manchester to the main room at Privilege in Ibiza - the world's biggest club ."

But a slanted Times “investigation” shows that the newspaper remains lost inside the U.S. government’�s “propaganda bubble,” writes Robert Parry . Parry: Most false narratives are not really about the past; they are about how the public perceives the present .  U.S. government operatives planted nasty propaganda about the targeted leader, stirred up political and economic chaos, spread rumors of worse violence to come and then chased away the duly elected leader . The preferred method in more recent years has been the “color revolution” which operates behind the faÃ§ade of a “peaceful” popular uprising .  In fall 2013, Ukraine’s President Yanukovych was exploring the idea of reaching out to Europe with an association agreement . But he got cold feet in November 2013 when economic experts in Kiev advised him that the Ukrainian economy would suffer a $160 billion hit if it separated from Russia, its eastern neighbor . Meanwhile, with Yanukovych shifting back toward Russia, which was offering a more generous $15 billion loan and discounted natural gas .  The mainstream U.S. press immediately blamed Yanukovych for the sniper attack, though the circumstances remain murky to this day . Yanukovych signed a European-brokered deal on Feb. 21, in which he accepted reduced powers and an early election so he could be voted out of office .  The New York Times presented a detailed, granular “investigation” of how there was no coup in Ukraine and reaffirmed the insistence that only Moscow stooges would think such a thing . But alternative news sources began to chip away at the preferred narrative .  European envoys met with Andriy Parubiy, the chief of the protesters’ security forces, and told him to keep the Lviv guns away from Kiev . The Times article is not a serious attempt to study the Ukraine coup . It would have looked at substantial evidence of Western interference and into other key facts, such as the identity of the snipers .  Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s . Instead, the article was just the latest attempt to pretend that the coup really wasn’t a coup ."

He's mentioned in this rather interesting article about sound recording:

I reached out to several professional sound editors, designers, and mixers, many of whom have won Oscars for their work on some of Hollywood's biggest films, to get to the bottom of what's going on . ""There are a number of root causes,"" says Mark Mangini .  Christopher Nolan is one of the most successful filmmakers of his generation . The director of ""Tenet,"" ""Interstellar,"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" often has trouble with sound design . Donald Sylvester, who won an Oscar for his work on ""Ford v Ferrari,"" says Nolan is a singular figure in this regard .  Acting styles have changed so dramatically over the years that it has become much more difficult to capture great sound on the set . ""Mumbling, breathy, I call it self-conscious type of acting, is so frustrating,"" Karen Baker Landers says . Sound professionals say they don't get the respect they need to get the microphone where it needs to be to capture sound clearly .  ""Sylvester: ""Pictures are the most important thing, and we do a good job fixing sound at the end of the day"" Craig Mann: ""There's more demand on crews to do many setups a day, and that could be a contributing factor"" Baker Landers: ""It's an art form to be a dialogue editor""  Digital audio and digital cinema have made it easier to edit on film and edit with tape . Sound pro Donald Sylvester says digital audio has made it harder for editors to do more with sound design . Sound pros say directors over-reliance on music as ""pushing emotion"" on audiences .  The director is sick of talking to the writer and giving them rewrites, and by the time you get to post, every single syllable is known by heart . ""In Craig Mann's experience, though, the idea of familiarity is not a widespread issue .  Mann says mixers and directors would want stuff mixed at a level that was just ear-bleeding . Mann says this isn't a new problem — it's actually been happening for decades . Mann: ""The idea that a significant theater chain would purposefully ignore industry standards for something as crucial as sound is genuinely shocking""  Union projectionists were largely kicked to the curb in favor of inexperienced employees . Mann: ""You're going to have some people on the mixing stage who want to turn [up that volume higher than the standard of 7] to compensate for the fact that theaters are playing it low"" Mann: Mixing sound for streaming has its own set of challenges .  Different streaming platforms have different specifications when it comes to their audio mixes . Craig Mann: ""Very often, the streamed audio is a compressed version that you wouldn't get on a Blu-ray"" ""Compression is inescapable when streaming is involved, but it turns out not all streaming platforms are created equal""  The historical record of the film will not be seen in theaters, it will be what you see in your home theater, says Karen Baker Landers . Not every filmmaker knows that you have to rebalance your film so it plays differently on a home theater . ""There's a lot of people who don't prioritize sound,"" says Thomas Curley .  ""We can do better in post in terms of how we manage those mixes that are designed specifically for a non-pristine sound environment,"" Mark Mangini says . Another prong involves having tough conversations on the set which establish priorities and make sure everyone is on the same page .  ""All it took was a little bit of collaboration and communication, and all of a sudden, grip and electric are moving generators a hundred yards away instead of having them right around the corner from the set . ""It takes an infinitesimal amount of extra effort to get us close to what we need, but it takes somebody with authority to make it happen,"" says Sylvester ."

It is hosted by Jan 'Yarn' Muths, of mixartists. com. au . In this episode Marc Brown, founder of Byta. com, talks about his career path and highlights .  Marc Brown founder and CEO of BYTA. com . Jan 'Yarn' Muths talks to Marc Brown of beta.com . The interview takes place in Stockholm, Sweden, Australia .  Marc Brown: I grew up in Canada and I was really into music from a very young age . He started having all these questions about why is it this way?  He says he didn't know what a tour was like touring or routing or routing .  Marc Brown moved to Sweden to Stockholm in 2016 and that was out right after sort of Brexit . He started working at a record label when he was 19 or 20 years old . He moved to London in 1990 and then moved to the UK in 1990 . He now lives in Stockholm, Sweden, Australia and has been at Bita since 2010 .  Marc Brown: I started doing radio plugging radio promotion, where, you know, you try to get songs on the radio, just like you do for press . The first band that sorta blew up there was this Swedish band called the high. The high. was one of the first bands I did is as a radio plugger we, it was crazy, and that went really well, like top 10 album .  Marc Brown: 'I just see myself as a, a bit player in a much larger thing' Jan 'Yarn' Muths: 'At what stage in band's career, would it be advisable to actually hire a professional for promotion?'  Marc Brown: 'I come from a DIY, do it yourself, background, that there are, I think you can do everything yourself initially and you should do in a sense.  But the idea of here and there are unique for every artist.  So when you say, when is the right time, it's like saying all artists are the same.  There's nothing wrong with figuring things out a bit for yourself .  Marc Brown: ""You don't need to just get lots of money and spend it all at once"" Jan 'Yarn' Muths: ""I got to find someone who knows something I have to pay them""  Jan 'Yarn' Muths: 'Everybody can take a couple of straightforward steps that everybody can take' 'You got to teach yourself some stuff, and then I guarantee it'll pay off later when you've learned a little more of yourself'  Jan 'Yarn' Muths: My currency is the people I know they're my assets, but what it is is it's the relationship that I had with those people . Marc Brown: The two things that when you hire someone they should have are the connections, those relationships that you build up over time . He says the big thing for independent musicians is this idea of timelines .  Bita is a tool for sending and receiving digital audio and sending digital audio . It also has an interview series about how people find and listen and experience new music . Its mission statement is to give artists and their teams, the tools and the knowledge .  Jan 'Yarn' Muths: I think it's very important that people don't focus too much on playlists being the most important thing or paying to get on playslists . Some platforms that say, oh, we can get you guaranteed place.  If for whatever reason, they don't take a song on a playlist, it's not the end of the world .  Marc Brown: Up to 60,000 tracks a day are uploaded to Spotify every day . He says it's hard to get your record into a record store, but no one knows your music exists .  Bita makes it easy to send and receive digital audio in a clean, simple and secure way . It doesn't matter if you're collaborating, you're promoting or you're just listening this . People find it easier to listen to music there's less time wasted, because everybody spends time clicking on links, downloading this, doing that different file formats .  Bita is one app that does that in a clean, simple and secure way . Artists need to think about when it comes to security, says Marc Brown . Piracy is not necessarily what you're worried about, he says .  Jan 'Yarn' Muths: I guess every time we need to talk about sound and the internet sound quality is.  It's subject that comes up sooner or later . Marc Brown: We're not, we don't live in a world where that will be the case.  A lot of people don't need very high res audio for ref when they reference things .  Marc Brown: I think that there's some pretty bad audio in certain places, but it's also that it doesn't need, I don't want anybody to think it needs to be high res all the time . There are certain use cases and you can't replicate going to a studio for one, he says .  Marc Brown: ""We are in this constant state of motion and, and changes"" Jan 'Yarn' Muths: If you had to, you know, guess and or or liquor look into your crystal ball, what would you expect for the next two years?  Jan 'Yarn' Muths: Is there anything that, you know, successful artists have in common?  I guess that's my question . Marc Brown: They work hard like it to be, to be a musician is you need to be creative, but you also need to work hard .  Marc Brown: ""There is no reason why you should have to pay for a platform"" He says he's working on expanding it further, giving it more features . There's another fourth plan coming soon .  Marc Brown: There's tons of new features to come.  The iOS app, Android app, all that kind of stuff.  We do, we do a monthly event.   We're doing one, um, like every month, basically towards the end of the month, the last, I think it's the last Tuesday of every month. We started putting that stuff up on YouTube.  I don't know if there's any of the talks I do. I do this one called the artist journey.  There's probably a lot to learn about music, marketing and promotion for most of us . Jan 'Yarn' Muths: Don't just take it aboard and listen passively.  It is now up to you to think about how all of this applies to your own music ."

The story of how lazy Jack got horses and armour and won the princess on the glass hill .

He presented the princess with the golden apples and revealed that he was the three knights .  Duncan Williamson heard this story from old Johnnie MacDonald . It is a Travellers' story . In one, a farmer refuses lodgings to a tramp who then dies in a wood . In the other a child asks its mother to sing the song about the tramp and the farmer .  Duncan Williamson's aunt Rachel was brought back after running away with a man and committed suicide aged forty-six . Two brothers, Jock and Hughie, were in a quarry and shared a bottle of whisky . Jock told Hughie about a fight there in which his father had been knocked down and broke his leg and was kicked by his opponent .  A king and queen were plagued by a giant . A henwife told the queen the giant was indestructible because his heart was in an egg in a swan's nest on an island .

The contributor believes the song may have been about a Campbell from Argyll who got into trouble in Inverary .  The song tells the story of the capture and execution of James MacPherson in 1700 . The man in the song is tired of farm work and tries his hand at tossing the caber at the local games .  Duncan Williamson does not like stories with too much magic in them . Children want to believe in a little magic, but too much and the story does not seem right .  When Travellers told stories to children they would stop and explain things and the children would ask questions . A boy who suffered after killing a frog was cured by a snake that he had saved from the frog .  Duncan Williamson heard this story from his father when he was very small .

Some people believe the Devil is more powerful than God; horses can detect the presence of evil where humans can't . Travellers also believe that if you look through between a horse's ears at night you will see what is disturbing the horse, but nobody will do this for fear of what they might see .  Some people on the west coast of Scotland, particularly in Sutherland, lived off the mussels and other shellfish they collected from the shoreline . This provided both a source of food and also a livelihood, as the shellfish could be sold to generate income .

The rich brother caught the wee man, who said he would grant him a wish if he carried a bag of oatmeal to the top of a high hill at midnight under the full moon . The green man then said the rich brother must go home and sign all his possessions over to his brother, then come back . When he did, the green man told him he could make any wish, provided it wasn't under the rays of the moon .  A poor Traveller family found a lucky magic pot, which brought them dinner and enough money to keep them in comfort . The Travellers thought some kind person had left it for them during the night .

The three enormous dogs came out and terrified everyone . The soldier was reprieved, got the dogs to bring the merchant three bags of gold .  Duncan Williamson gives some examples of Travellers' riddles and guesses . Some of these were made up by the Travellers themselves . A riddle is different from a guess because it gives you a clue .  The words of a song and the style of singing are different among Travellers in different parts of Scotland . The storyteller Johnnie MacDonald, who was brought up in Argyllshire, had different versions of songs depending on where he had picked them up .  Jock Williamson recites a bit of Burns' poem about toothache . Jock tells of seeing the house in Dumfries where Burns died and describes its contents . Duncan Williamson tells his niece April that her uncle saw the ghost of a woman at Stanley .

Contributor's uncle Sandy Reid (married to contributor's mother's sister Bella) from Dunbartonshire told him this story .  People cry when they hear a song because it brings back memories of the person who used to sing it, and a singer makes more emotional impact when they are singing to a particular person rather than to an audience .  A talking goat breaks up a family but is driven out in turn . John Barleycorn is killed by three kings who plough him into the ground . He is resurrected when the rain falls on him .  The singer praises John Barleycorn, and says that his blood can make a man forget his woes .

In this song, John Barleycorn is killed by three kings who plough him into the ground, but he is resurrected when the rain falls on him .

If a child brings back a pail of water with a well-washer in it, the water has to be poured back where it came from .

The contributor thinks the ballad relates to Robin Hood .  Jack ruined his mother's cloth by wrapping it round a thorn bush, but found a box of gold beneath the roots . A story explaining that the bundles of twigs seen on birch trees are the remains of witches' besoms .

The Molecatcher's Flitting and The Death of Queen Jane are told of the MacDonald Travellers' songs . The stories are told by Duncan Williamson, Betsy Whyte and Katie Johnston . Some of the songs are explained .  Auld Peasie's first man was Alec (also known as Sandy) Reid and her second, who was a distant cousin of the first, was Sandy Burke . Duncan Williamson's grandmother, whose own name was Maggie MacPhee and who was known as 'Spotty', had children by three men, the first of whom was John Townsley, and the second Eric Reid .  Duncan Williamson was told the story of the giant with the golden hair in Coupar Angus by old Johnny MacDonald, a Traveller who walked with crutches . A poor man predestined to marry a princess does so after man .  A boatman agreed to take him to the giant's island, and asked him to find out why he was compelled to stay in his boat and row constantly . The giant's mother helped him find out from the giant that there was a padlock and chain under the roots of the tree, which had to be cut before the tree could bear fruit . The lad returned with the rewards and the three golden hairs and told the king the story . The king got to be king and lived happily ever after .  Riddles composed by prisoners who went free because no one could solve their riddles . Duncan Williamson heard the story from his mother's mother, who was a MacDonald from Argyll . He explains that in the olden days if a prisoner could make up a riddle that no one can solve he could go free .  The Hawker's Lament is a protest song lamenting the closure of Travellers' camping grounds . The Balmoral Highlanders is a 2/4 march derived from Thomas Campbell's poem 'Lord Ullin's Daughter'  There were about seventy-five pupils in the school when contributor was there, and about thirty in his class .

Duncan Williamson recalls his father telling stories a bit at a time on winter nights around the campfire . He plays 'MacPherson's Farewell' on the mouth-organ .

He used to be promised a story in return for going for tobacco, and if the promise wasn't kept .  Duncan Williamson was born in a tent in Argyll in 1928 . Describes Travellers telling stories, singing, diddling, cantering and playing the pipes . He prefers the low-built gelly tent from Skye, with a chimney .  A wicked fairy made a baby into a hedgehurst (half human, half hedgehog), but when he grew up a princess broke the spell . Duncan Williamson heard this story from old Johnny MacDonald, who was a great stroryteller in the real Traveller style . Duncan thinks his father might have heard the stories from his father before him .  Jeannie Johnston and her son Duncan were typical of the mother and son represented in Jack tales . Jack and his mother in stories were not particular people but representative of every Traveller woman left with a son and no husband . Jeannie was from Pitlochry and Duncan Williamson was at school until he was 14 .  There are so many Jack stories among Travellers because Jack was a hero to them, like Wallace, Bruce, or Davy Crockett . In the stories, he was doing what they would like to have done .  Old Sandy Cameron's mother told this one at a gathering round the campfire: ""In fir rosin, in oak nonis / In clay eelis, in earth nonis""  This was one of Johnnie MacDonald's stories from the Western Isles . Blind Rory was banished away from people because he was bad . He put curses on boats passing by so they ran on the rocks . A mermaid's head appeared and warned Jack never to catch a mermaid .  A king wished for everything he touched to be turned to gold, but agreed to share his wealth to have his wish undone . Duncan Williamson talks about how his Traveller family got food when he was a child .  Travellers told stories only to their own families, and as much enjoyment was had from telling them as from hearing them . It was the only entertainment folk used to have . Children looked forward to hearing a story, and would do chores and run messages if a story was promised .  A king got a pet baby deer for his daughter when he was out hunting . She said she would only marry the man who could catch her deer on horseback . An old woman told the princess about her sister's son Jack, the cleverest man in the world, in a faraway land . Jack won the princess by catching the deer with the golden horns .  The princess left a message for Jack, ""I live in a faraway land across the Red Sea.  My body's made of iron and my wings are made of steel and he'll never reach the land that I live in"" Jack set off in search of the princess . His mother told him to look up his three uncles who might be able to help him find the princess and the iron eagle .  The ogre told Jack he must clean out the stable before he could have the horse . The more anyone cleaned the stable, the more dung would fly in . But a wee man with a humped back who was the orgre's slave helped Jack by telling him to reverse the graip [dungfork] and fling the dung back out with the handle . Jack caught the deer by the horns and they were married and lived happily ever after .  Duncan Williamson heard the story from his mother's brother, Johnnie Townsley, when he was about five . A person's style of diddling can be good or bad, but it is possible to diddle any tune you know well .  Jack was the youngest of three brothers, who set out to seek his fortune with a small bannock and collop [slice of meat] and his widowed mother's blessing . The brothers agreed to meet back at their mother's house in a year and a day . Each learned that the king's daughter had lost her pearls and ring and the king had promised her hand in marriage and half the kingdom to any man who could find them .  The contributors recall seeing their family members reduced to tears when listening to songs around the campfire, often because of their memories of hearing other loved ones sing the same song .  Duncan Williamson heard the story of the giant with the golden hair from old Johnny MacDonald, a Traveller who walked with crutches . Duncan Williamson's father would not have had a fire like his, in a tank and with a chimney .  Duncan Williamson heard this song, which he ascribes to Robert Burns, from his father, and says it is sung a lot by Travellers . Travellers usually used to carry all their equipment on their backs or push it in hand-carts .  A goat that lied about its treatment was found out, banished and eventually driven over a cliff by bees . A hunchbacked boy had a fairy gift of fiddling, but his grandparents kept him in isolation and he had a tragic death .  After the massacre of Glencoe the MacDonalds swore they would have revenge . The first Campbell they met would be hanged from the first tree . The song tells the story of Geordie Campbell on whom this revenge was taken .  Betsy Whyte was born with a lucky cap (a caul) over her head . People who possess a caul will never drown, and the nurse who delivered Betsy wanted to give the caul to her brother, a seaman .  Jack was taken to Elfland and had to perform tasks before getting back home with a reward . He was turned into a wee man a foot high and found himself in Elfland . He had to bring an acorn cupful of dew for the elfin queen, who was ill as a result of enchantment by a wizard . He stole the magic stick from the wizard, with the help of a shape-changing ring . Jack told his mother he had found the gold in the moss .  The contributor learned the song from his grandmother, Mary, in Pitlochry, when he was 17 . She used to carry a 'wee muskin - a small gill of whisky - in a shawl around her shoulders .  Duncan Williamson diddles 'Sir Patrick Spens' and 'Over the Sea to Skye' as canntaireachd . He says any tune, including ballads, can be diddled, so long as suitable syllables are chosen . Duncan's cousin, Sandy Townsley from Campbeltown, is a versatile piper . Duncan opines that diddling is dying out .  Duncan Williamson heard this story a long time ago from old Johnnie MacDonald, who told it to him in two parts on successive nights . The princess set off disguised as a goose girl to get the cure from a queen in a faraway country . In a forest she unknowingly met the queen's son, who fell in love with her and agreed to help her .  Jimmy Hughes is in the process of writing the lyrics for a song for which he hopes Duncan Williamson will provide the music . The words are about Travellers always being moved on, though they deserve better society, having served in society .  Duncan Williamson diddles the tune of 'The Death of Queen Jane', then sings some verses . He composed these verses in the last week of June 1976 .  Duncan Williamson talks about how he remembers stories and where they came from . The stories that mean the most to Duncan Williamson are animal stories and stories he heard at school . He remembers stories by remembering the situations when he was told them, and the tellers .  The only person Duncan Williamson ever heard tell stories about George Buchanan was his father . George was supposed to have been a fool, but was very fly [crafty]. The stories were supposed to be set in Scotland in about the eleventh century .  A rich American brings Travellers as his guests to a hotel that turned them away . He rented the whole hotel for a week for £5000 saying it was to entertain some friends . He invited all the Travellers, Gypsies and tramps he could find to stay at the hotel, and they came in their hundreds . The hotel owner offered him £10,000 to get rid of them .  Song has too many repetitions of the meaningless syllables of the refrain and it gets boring for listeners . Song is about Hind Horn's father disapproves of the girl his son loves and sends his son away to sea . The girl gives Hind Horn her gold ring, telling him that if it grows dull she will be in trouble .  The story is about a cuckoo rescued from a farm by Jack, one of three brothers on a farm . He rescued an enchanted bird from a faraway country and said it would come back on 1st May and bring a present to the princess on her birthday . Jack had no money to buy a present, because his brothers never paid him for his work on the farm . The prince and the princess were married, the king got a whole tree of magic leaves, and Jack was made rich .  Duncan Williamson heard this story from his father only once, and this was the only time he had retold it . The king's evil was a skin disease which people used to believe could be cured by the touch of a king . Duncan's father possibly heard the story from Isa's maternal grandmother .  A pet lamb, a donkey, a goose and a cockerel found a new home by frightening robbers out of their hut . The animals made a plan to scare the robbers away . The robbers fled and never returned and stayed in the hut for the rest of their days .  In this Traveller's song, the man talks of the various parts of Scotland to which he has travelled for work . He soon resigns himself to the fact that he can no longer earn enough in Scotland so he resolves to go to Paddy's land [Ireland]."

She is there because she probably won the 2020 presidential election in Belarus, and because the Belarusian dictator she probably defeated, Alexander Lukashenko, forced her out of the country immediately afterward . Ghitis says her husband, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, remains imprisoned in Belarus .  Frida Ghitis: Unlike her husband, she registered as a candidate in 2020, she was afraid . She woke up “so scared” every morning, she told Ghitis, but kept going . Ghitis says she and many others naively believed that under this pressure, the dictator would just give up . She says Belarusians shared a sense of national unity they had never felt before .  David Rothkopf: Lukashenko and Putin share a common way of seeing the world . He says they fear that a change of regime would result in their death, imprisonment, or exile . He asks: If you can stamp them out in one country, you might prevent them from starting in others . Rothkapf: If Ukrainians could get rid of their corrupt dictator, why wouldn’t Russians want to do the same?  Belarusian air traffic control forced an Irish-owned Ryanair passenger plane to land in Minsk so that one of the passengers, Roman Protasevich, a young dissident living in exile, could be arrested . At about the same time, Belarus’s regime set out to destabilize its EU neighbors by forcing streams of refugees across their borders .  Boris Berezovitch: Tsikhanouskaya became, for the second time, a runaway success . She charmed Merkel and Macron, and the diplomats of multiple countries, Berezovich says . He says she has language of human rights, democracy, and justice; she also has the support of people around the world who still fervently believe that politics can be made more civilized, more rational, more humane .  Frida Ghitis: Among modern autocrats are people who call themselves communists, nationalists, and theocrats . She says the new autocratic alliance doesn't have a unifying ideology but has links to each other . Ghitis says the members of this group don't operate like a bloc, but rather like an agglomeration of companies .  Frida Ghitis: Venezuelan dissidents are fighting multiple autocrats in multiple countries . Ghitis says they are fighting against people who have inured themselves to the feelings and opinions of their countrymen . The most brutal members of Autocracy Inc. don’t much care if their countries are criticized, Ghitis writes .  Julian Zelizer: Modern autocrats are using aggressive tactics to push back against mass protest . He says Putin was unembarrassed to stage “elections” earlier this year in which some 9 million people were barred from being candidates . The Burmese junta is unashamed to have murdered hundreds of protesters, including young teenagers, on the streets of Yangon . Zelizer asks: How have modern autocrats achieved impunity?  Kalbinur Tursun is a Uyghur, a member of China’s predominantly Muslim Chinese minority, born in Xinjiang . She had six children, too many in a country where there are strict rules limiting births . When she became pregnant again, she feared being harassed by police, as women with more than two children often are . She and her husband decided to move to Turkey; after she and her daughter were settled, her husband returned for the rest of the family . She has not spoken with her husband since .  Frida Ghitis: Abdureshid, a Uyghur, came to Turkey as a student convinced that she had the backing of the Chinese state . She contacted the consulate in Istanbul and officials there finally told her the truth: Her father, mother, and younger brother were in prison camps, each for “preparing to commit terrorist activities. ” Ghitis says there are dozens, hundreds, perhaps thousands of such stories there .  Turkey is singularly linked to the Uyghur community by ties of religion, ethnicity, and language . Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who was then the Turkish prime minister, called the Chinese repression of the UYghurs a “genocide ” Erdoğan’s interest in Chinese friendship, investment, and technology has increased, along with his willingness to echo Chinese propaganda .  For autocrats and would-be autocrats around the world, the Chinese offer a package that looks something like this: Agree to follow China’s lead on Hong Kong, Tibet, the Uyghurs, and human rights more broadly . The Saudis, the Emiratis, and the Egyptians have all allegedly arrested, detained, and deported Uyaghurs without much discussion .  The United Front is the Chinese Communist Party’s influence project, subtler and more strategic than the Russian version . Some Americans actively welcomed this intervention, and even sought to take advantage of what they imagined might be broader Russian technical capabilities . The long arm of the Chinese state has reached Chinese dissidents in the U.S. as well .  In 2018, McKinsey held a tone-deaf corporate retreat in Kashgar, just a few miles away from a Uyghur internment camp . The list of major American corporations caught in tangled webs of personal, financial, and business links to China, Russia, and other autocracies is very long .  Frida Ghitis: If autocrats and the kleptocrats feel no shame, why should American celebrities profit from their largesse? She says Nicki Minaj was criticized for giving a concert in Angola, hosted by a company co-owned by the daughter of that country’s dictator . Ghitis says sanctions, especially when hastily applied in the aftermath of some outrage, do not have the impact they once did .  American foreign-language broadcasters continue to serve as independent sources of information in some closed societies . But while Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty spends just over $22 million on Russian-language broadcasting every year, the Russian government spends billions on state media that are seen and heard all over Eastern Europe, from Germany to Moldova to Kazakhstan .  Julian Zelizer: Statements made at a diplomatic summit won't achieve much if politicians, citizens, and businesses don’t act as if they matter . To effect real change, the Biden administration will have to ask hard questions and make big decisions, Zelizer says . He says we need a major investment in independent media around the world, a strategy for reaching people inside autocracies, new international institutions to replace the defunct UN .  Hong Kong prodemocracy protesters waving American flags believe many of the same things we believe . But their requests for U.S. support in 2019 did not elicit a significant wave of youthful activism in the United States, not even something comparable to the anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s . Autocracies will quickly take our place as sources of influence, funding, and ideas ."
