The premise of these programs is to give you the ability to take a picture of a musical score or choral octavo, hear it playback instantly, and then be able to export that picture as a MIDI or XML file . In this blog, we will look at two popular, low-cost apps for scanning sheet music .  PlayScore 2 recently released an iOS update 2. 8 that includes the following new features: count-in, added recorder instrument voice, increased performance, auto-lock override, and MusicXML export with lyrics, text, and guitar tabs . The app is available in both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store for mobile Android and iPhone/iPad devices .  Both scanning apps dramatically decrease in effectiveness if there is even a slight shadow on the page . Use high-quality printed sheet music and take photos under good enough light for optimal results .  Sheet Music Scanner did not struggle as much as I thought it would on this third and most difficult piece . PlayScore 2 struggled to handle the repeat section or ignore the repeat entirely .  Katie Wardrobe is an Australian music technology trainer and consultant with a passion for helping music teachers through her business Midnight Music . The fact that you can take a picture with your phone and have the music playback with upwards of 90%+ accuracy is incredible!",1,0.3481883044969296,0.5861781786446999,1379
