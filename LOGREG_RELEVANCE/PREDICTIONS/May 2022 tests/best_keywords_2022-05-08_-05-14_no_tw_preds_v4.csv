In general, heavier materials (those with higher mass densities) have slower speeds of sound, all else being equal .  When you talk, you do so by emitting air and then sending compression waves through this air . Your lungs provide the burst of air, and your vibrating vocal cords and mouth imprint the appropriate sound waveform on the air . Sound waves have a hard time going from air into water and mostly get reflected at the air-water interface instead of being transmitted into the water .",1,0.11174126038732446,0.527906284394605,621
