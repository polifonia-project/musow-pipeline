The trumpeter beat the likes of Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday – all of whom made the top 10 .  Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue is the “best-selling jazz record of all time” (Rolling Stone) The success of the record can rightfully be attributed to Davis' productive creativity . Davis had a knack for recognizing talent, and he “launched the careers” of many notable jazz musicians . His 1970 record, Bitches Brew is considered the foundation of jazz-rock fusion .  Bitches Brew (Rolf and Watts) was certified platinum (1 million copies sold) by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2003 (RIAA) Many credit the album with a resurgence in jazz popularity and commercial sales throughout the ‘70s . The album became known as “cool jazz”; indicative of where its popularity took hold .  Louis Armstrong’s music in the 1920s, in particular on his Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings from 1925-1929, is considered by some to be “the most exciting and influential in jazz music” (Rolf and Watts 46) While Armstrong continued to play jazz trumpet with masterful skill after the ‘20s, he turned his productive efforts to being a singer and entertainer .  Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington, and others are deserving of admiration, respect, and recognition for their significant contribution to jazz . But only one can claim the designation, “most influential,” and that belongs solely to Davis .  Davis, Francis.  Kind Of Blue [Legacy Edition].

Jarrett started his career with Art Blakey, moving on to play with Charles Lloyd and Miles Davis . His album The Köln Concert (1975) became the best-selling piano recording in history .  The Charles Lloyd Quartet's 1966 album Forest Flower was one of the most successful jazz recordings of the mid-1960s . The Quartet’s tours across America, Europe, and Moscow made Jarrett a popular musician in rock and jazz . Jarrett joined the Miles Davis group after the trumpeter heard him in a New York City club .  Jarrett recorded a few solo pieces live under the guidance of Miles Davis at Washington’s music club The Cellar Door in December 1970 . In the mid/late 1970s, Jarrett led a “European quartet” with saxophonist Jan Garbarek, bassist Palle Danielsson and drummer Jon Christensen .  In 1973, Jarrett began playing totally improvised solo concerts . The Köln Concert became the best-selling piano recording in history . In the late 1990s, Jarrett was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and was unable to leave his home for long periods of time .  Jarrett recorded The Melody at Night, with You, a solo piano effort consisting of jazz standards presented with very little of the reinterpretation he usually employs . Jarrett-Peacock-DeJohnette trio became one of the premier working groups in jazz, continuing to record and tour for over 25 years .  The standards trio undertook frequent world tours of recital halls (the only venues in which Jarrett, a notorious stickler for acoustics, will play) Since the early 1970s, Jarrett’s success as a jazz musician has enabled him to maintain a parallel career as a classical composer and pianist .  Jarrett has recorded classical works for ECM by composers such as Bach, Handel, Shostakovich, and Arvo Pärt .
