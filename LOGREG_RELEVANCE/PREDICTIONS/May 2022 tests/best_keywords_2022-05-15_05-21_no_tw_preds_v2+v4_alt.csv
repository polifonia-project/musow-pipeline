Miles Davis is the only predominantly jazz artist to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explicitly for his direct contribution to rock and roll . Davis' best and most influential recording, his 1959 record, Kind of Blue, is one of its signature tracks .  Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue is considered the “best-selling jazz record of all time” (Rolling Stone) The success of the record can be attributed to Davis' productive creativity which extended beyond his musical compositions and his understated elegance on the trumpet . Another of Davis' works that spawned several successful careers is his 1970 record, Bitches Brew .  Bitches Brew (Rolf and Watts) was released in 1968 . It was certified platinum (1 million copies sold) by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2003 (RIAA) Many credit the album with a resurgence in jazz popularity and commercial sales throughout the ‘70s .  Armstrong’s music in the 1920s, in particular on his Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings from 1925-1929, is considered by some to be “the most exciting and influential in jazz music” Armstrong continued to play jazz trumpet with masterful skill after the ‘20s, he turned his productive efforts to being a singer and entertainer .  Miles Davis influenced, innovated, and instigated multiple styles of jazz during his lifetime . Davis was consistently branching jazz in directions it had not yet traveled . Davis credited other musicians for their contributions .  Miles Dewey Davis III, a great trumpeter and composer, was one of the major influences on the art from the late 1940s . His unique, intimate tone and his fertile musical imagination outweighed his technical shortcomings . He formed classic small groups in the 1950s that featured saxophonelegends John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley, pianists Red Garland and Bill Evans .  Kind of Blue includes the finest recorded examples of modal jazz, a style in which improvisations are based upon sparse chords and nonstandard scales rather than on complex, frequently changing chords . The early 1960s were transitional, less-innovative years for Davis, although his music and his playing remained top-calibre .  The Davis quintet’s experimentations in polyrhythm and polytonality were more subtle but equally daring . Bitches Brew (1969), an album on which he fully embraced the rhythms, electronic instrumentation, and studio effects of rock music . The album's influence was heard in such 1970s fusion groups as Weather Report ."

The work represents an important stylistic bridge between Classical and Romantic periods of Western music history .  Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 foreshadowed the monolithic works of Gustav Mahler, Richard Wagner, and other composers of the later Romantic era . The inclusion of a chorus in a genre that was understood to be exclusively instrumental was thoroughly unorthodox . The symphony's menacing second movement in brisk waltz time provided a backdrop for some of the most tense and twisted moments in Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange .  The Creative Development of Johann Sebastian Bach (1695-1717) Vol.  Piazzolla) Two pianos – pianists Argerich and Hubert- Out of Africa – music by John Barry (piano solo)"

He is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the “Three Bs” of music .  The diligent, highly constructed nature of Brahms’s works was a starting point and inspiration for a generation of composers . Embedded within his meticulous structures, however, are deeply romantic motifs . He wrote a number of major works for orchestra, including two Serenades, four symphonies, two piano concertos (No. 1 in D minor; No. 2 in B-flat major) and two companion orchestral overtures .  Brahms was an influence on composers of both conservative and modernist tendencies . His idiom left an imprint on several composers within his personal circle, such as Heinrich von Herzogenberg, Robert Fuchs, and Julius Röntgen .  Anton Webern claimed Brahms had anticipated developments of the Second Viennese School . Ann Scott has shown how Brahms anticipated the procedures of serialists by redistributing melodic fragments between instruments ."

Influenced by Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Balakirev, Mussorgsky and other Russian composers .  Rachmaninoff composed three one-act operas: Aleko (1892), The Miserly Knight (1903), and Francesca da Rimini (1904) He also composed many songs for voice and piano, to texts by A. N. Tolstoy, Pushkin, Goethe, Shelley and Chekhov .  Rachmaninoff’s compositional style had already begun changing before the October Revolution deprived him of his homeland . He started leaning towards sumptuous harmonies and broadly lyrical, often passionate melodies . His orchestration became subtler and more varied, with textures carefully contrasted .  Rachmaninoff ranked among the finest pianists of his time, along with Leopold Godowsky, Ignaz Friedman, Moriz Rosenthal, Josef Lhévinne, Ferruccio Busoni and Josef Hofmann .  Rachmaninoff's playing was marked by precision, rhythmic drive, notable use of staccato and ability to maintain clarity when playing works with complex textures . He may have based his interpretation of the Chopin sonata on that of Anton Rubinstein .

It is usually referred to as The Tempest (or Der Sturm in his native German), but the sonata was not given this title .  Op.  2 sonata “the most dramatic that Beethoven had yet conceived, with a contrast of tempos and motifs, and a radical opposition of mood . “The opening motif…is a motto and it will govern the entire work” “This opening is constructed in a set of antecedent/consequent phrases.”  In the first movement of Op.  31, no. 2, the bass rises gradually over 20 bars (98-118) as the development section gets underway . An implied augmented sixth chord based on Bb propels the piece into a 12-bar prolongation of the A major dominant in fortissimo (bars 121- 132) Then a 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 melodic descent (for A major) in whole notes, with an A pedal in the bass, brings us to bar 137, where we get a hint of the recapitulation .  Op. 31 No. 2 is a redefinition of sonata form in terms of a transformational process, rather than a neatly divisible form . At the outset of the piece, the rolled/arpeggiated A major chord in the first two bars appears to be more like introductory material that precedes the main theme . Bar 1 first presents itself as a prelude lacking in thematic significance, later (when viewed in retrospect from bar 21) as the anticipation of the theme and finally (after it has emerged that bars 21-40 are a modulating developmental passage) as  The listener thus “follows the process of transformation” in which the motives/themes fulfill several functions at a time and the processual aspect of structure coexists with, if not supersedes, the theoretical divisions of sonata form . While the motivic relationships and their transformations are probably the clearest within the first movement, there are notable connections between the movements as well .  The opening thematic statement is richer in what it implies, than what it actually contains . The second movement is cast in the most traditional form of the three movements . The third movement starts with a clear tonic D in the bass, the pedal A in the tenor voice .  Op. 31 No. 2 is his first attempt at such a technique and represents a very important innovation . The first theme material does appear almost verbatim and the choice of the key to which Beethoven transposes it here (bar 150) – B flat minor– is quite intriguing .  The sonata Op. 27, no. 1 is one of the set of two sonatas subtitled by Beethoven “Quasi una fantasia’s “Moonlight” sonata . Op. 31 No. 1 (written 1800-1801) goes from Eb (movement 1 – Andante) to C minor . The first 6 bars of the third movement are largely cut and pasted before the coda in the fourth movement .  The Op. 20’s sonatas confirm that for Beethoven the piano sonataas were a field of experimentation”. “The Op. 27, no.  2 and Op. 28” were a one-key for the entire work, with C# minor (Adagio sostenuto) – Db (Allegretto) – C# major(Presto agitato) in Op.  28 .  Op. 31, no. 2 sonata may be seen as continuing a crystallization of thoughts that Beethoven had been exploring for some time’s personal crisis associated with his hearing loss . Many techniques were already used or toyed with in previous works .  The Creative Development of Johann Sebastian Bach (1695-1717) Vol.  I and II is published by Indiana University Press. It is titled Masters of the Keyboard: Individual Style Elements in the PIano Music of Bach ."
