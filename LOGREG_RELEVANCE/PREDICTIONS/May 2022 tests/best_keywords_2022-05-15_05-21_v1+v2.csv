Miles Davis is the only predominantly jazz artist to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explicitly for his direct contribution to rock and roll . Davis' best and most influential recording, his 1959 record, Kind of Blue, is one of its signature tracks .  Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue is considered the “best-selling jazz record of all time” (Rolling Stone) The success of the record can be attributed to Davis' productive creativity which extended beyond his musical compositions and his understated elegance on the trumpet . Another of Davis' works that spawned several successful careers is his 1970 record, Bitches Brew .  Bitches Brew (Rolf and Watts) was released in 1968 . It was certified platinum (1 million copies sold) by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2003 (RIAA) Many credit the album with a resurgence in jazz popularity and commercial sales throughout the ‘70s .  Armstrong’s music in the 1920s, in particular on his Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings from 1925-1929, is considered by some to be “the most exciting and influential in jazz music” Armstrong continued to play jazz trumpet with masterful skill after the ‘20s, he turned his productive efforts to being a singer and entertainer .  Miles Davis influenced, innovated, and instigated multiple styles of jazz during his lifetime . Davis was consistently branching jazz in directions it had not yet traveled . Davis credited other musicians for their contributions .  Miles Dewey Davis III, a great trumpeter and composer, was one of the major influences on the art from the late 1940s . His unique, intimate tone and his fertile musical imagination outweighed his technical shortcomings . He formed classic small groups in the 1950s that featured saxophonelegends John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley, pianists Red Garland and Bill Evans .  Kind of Blue includes the finest recorded examples of modal jazz, a style in which improvisations are based upon sparse chords and nonstandard scales rather than on complex, frequently changing chords . The early 1960s were transitional, less-innovative years for Davis, although his music and his playing remained top-calibre .  The Davis quintet’s experimentations in polyrhythm and polytonality were more subtle but equally daring . Bitches Brew (1969), an album on which he fully embraced the rhythms, electronic instrumentation, and studio effects of rock music . The album's influence was heard in such 1970s fusion groups as Weather Report ."

He is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the “Three Bs” of music .  The diligent, highly constructed nature of Brahms’s works was a starting point and inspiration for a generation of composers . Embedded within his meticulous structures, however, are deeply romantic motifs . He wrote a number of major works for orchestra, including two Serenades, four symphonies, two piano concertos (No. 1 in D minor; No. 2 in B-flat major) and two companion orchestral overtures .  Brahms was an influence on composers of both conservative and modernist tendencies . His idiom left an imprint on several composers within his personal circle, such as Heinrich von Herzogenberg, Robert Fuchs, and Julius Röntgen .  Anton Webern claimed Brahms had anticipated developments of the Second Viennese School . Ann Scott has shown how Brahms anticipated the procedures of serialists by redistributing melodic fragments between instruments ."

Adagio (Advanced Piano Solo) & Sheet Music , Sheet Music Library (PDF)"," Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff was a Russian composer, virtuoso pianist, and conductor of the late Romantic period . Influenced by Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Balakirev, Mussorgsky and other Russian composers .  Rachmaninoff composed three one-act operas: Aleko (1892), The Miserly Knight (1903), and Francesca da Rimini (1904) He also composed many songs for voice and piano, to texts by A. N. Tolstoy, Pushkin, Goethe, Shelley and Chekhov .  Rachmaninoff’s compositional style had already begun changing before the October Revolution deprived him of his homeland . He started leaning towards sumptuous harmonies and broadly lyrical, often passionate melodies . His orchestration became subtler and more varied, with textures carefully contrasted .  Rachmaninoff ranked among the finest pianists of his time, along with Leopold Godowsky, Ignaz Friedman, Moriz Rosenthal, Josef Lhévinne, Ferruccio Busoni and Josef Hofmann .  Rachmaninoff's playing was marked by precision, rhythmic drive, notable use of staccato and ability to maintain clarity when playing works with complex textures . He may have based his interpretation of the Chopin sonata on that of Anton Rubinstein .  The Creative Development of Johann Sebastian Bach (1695-1717) Vol.  I and II is published in Bach’s first edition of The Bach Collection ."

The song was the only Dixon composition ever to become a number one R&B single .

The first recorded take of the first song attempted at his debut session became his first number one hit, spending eight weeks at the top of the Billboard R&B chart . “Juke” was the biggest hit to date for any artist on Chess and its affiliated labels .  Little Walter's sound was more modern and up-tempo than popular Chicago blues of the day . Jacobs left Waters's band in 1952 and recruited his own backing band, the Aces . Jacobs suffered from alcoholism and had a notoriously short temper, which led to violent altercations .  In 1967 Chess released a studio album, Super Blues, featuring Little Walter, Bo Diddley, and Muddy Waters . Little Walter’s daughter, Marion Diaz Reacco, has established the Little Walter Foundation in Chicago, to preserve the legacy and genius of Little Walter ."
