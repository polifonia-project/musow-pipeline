Sheet Music Scanner has a few limitations including: “Reads printed sheet music, not handwritten or mimicking handwriting.” The app currently reads 3 clefs: treble, bass, and alto . PlayScore 2 encourages you to scan music vertically rather than horizontally .  Sheet Music Scanner did reasonably well on this song . PlayScore 2 struggled to handle the repeat of a repeat . All voices were played in a piano voice .  Katie Wardrobe has created an entire course called, “How To Scan Sheet Music” She walks you through importing a scanned XML file, how to transpose a file, as well as fixing scanning mistakes, and even showcases more advanced arranging methods .  I like to focus on easy ways to incorporate technology into what you are already doing in your music curriculum .
