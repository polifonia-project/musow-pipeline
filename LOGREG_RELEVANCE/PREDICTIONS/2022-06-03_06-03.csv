The developer of this app is developed by the Sao Mai Center for the Blind . The app is connected with an online music library, containing thousands of music pieces .  SM Music Library has an extensive list of scores available for free download . Double tap on the title you want to download to open in the Score List . If you double tap and hold on a score, it shows additional information such as reporting an error . You can also play a song by flicking right and VoiceOver will say the notes or chord .  There is no order of results for a specific composer . The toolbar on the Score List is very inconsistent . The Downloads section usually showed one or two scores that I had downloaded . The scores section sometimes showed all my scores, but usually only some were listed .  VoiceOver does not speak the names of parts of music that are on the screen, but VoiceOver doesn't speak their names . There are in-page links for how to optimize recognition and fix some problems .  If you have some vision you may be able to use this app . It is impossible for someone without vision to scan music and you would need to deal with unlabeled controls . The developer was very responsive to my questions and is working to improve accessibility .",
