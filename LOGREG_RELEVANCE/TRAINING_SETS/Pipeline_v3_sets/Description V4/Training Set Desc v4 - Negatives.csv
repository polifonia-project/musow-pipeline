The Next Renaissance Will Be Digital | IE Insights,"The French focused almost exclusively on the engineering and financial aspects of the Panama Canal, treating construction as a purely technical issue . The Americans, meanwhile, took a broader approach and managed to turn around a project that had fallen into disarray . The iPhone bases its strength on combining technical knowledge of engineers with that of designers, linguists, anthropologists and other social scientists . The world needs a new renaissance in which leaders across industries not only have the technological knowledge to address problems but also possess the humanistic vision to understand what needs to be done, why, and for whom . Technology and science teach us how to do things, the humanities enable us to think about why we do them . The humanities may be the key to figuring out where we as a society want to go . It is time for a rebirth, a modern-day renaissance of the digital humanities, to create educated citizens . Otherwise, the next generations could feel lost and unable to understand the reality of their lives .",https://www.ie.edu/insights/articles/the-next-renaissance-will-be-digital/,0,Scrapes v3,

Nazmus Saquib - Digital Humanities: Reflection,"The Islamicate Digital Humanities Network (IDHN) will organize a conference that will showcase a lot of my team’s research on understanding Hadiths as a narrative network . This is a special moment for all of us in the team, and definitely a milestone for me because I have been working on this meaty idea for close to a decade with my mentor/collaborator Mairaj Syed . I hope it might help both sides of digital humanities to understand each other and manage expectations . Mairaj was not an expert in web scraping, data mining, or network science, but over the next few years he taught himself a lot of the tricks by studying my and other people’s code . At the moment, our work's portfolio includes 1400 parsed books, with 50,000 authors and millions of links between them, and a collection of data analysis and visualization techniques . The impact of our team’s Hadith analytics works could be equated to several PhDs . The research works in humanities are often done by lone rangers, instead of large international collaborations and teams that are frequently seen in the sciences . A recipe for disaster is to build an interdisciplinary team whose members don't know (or trust) each other’s strengths, or don’t have the capability to understand the available strengths properly . The premature search for can-explain-it-all theories is quite abundant in both the humanities and sciences . Some North American humanities professors were just reading out loud in some conference sessions . I didn't realize slides that can instantly make you fall asleep could be part of the same sessions . Dissemination of knowledge in widely understandable and enjoyable formats should be prioritized by any researcher . The way humans create meaning and form abstractions have profound implications in science, math, and humanities cultures . Wittgenstein called this phenomenon sign game . Mathematical abstractions are powerful tools for thinking and taking shortcuts in the process of ""meaning making"" Computer Science has given us very powerful tools and metaphors to model the world's information . It comes with the risk of wrong interpretations and predictions, or missing out nuances . We need a culture of appreciation for different abstractions .",https://www.nsaquib.org/blog/digital-humanities-reflection,0,Scrapes v3,
Frontiers | A New Kind of Relevance for Archaeology | Digital Humanities,"Despite recent efforts the practical relevance of archaeology has remained limited . In this paper I discuss why this is the case and suggest how archaeology can achieve greater practical relevance . I argue that the traditional focus on reconstructing the past is valuable but is unlikely to expand its practical relevance because the results are too context-specific . If archaeology is to achieve greater practical relevance it will not be through research that reconstructs the past or makes broad generalizations . Instead, it will come from studies of specific social phenomena regardless of where or when they occur . The ability to predict is generally beneficial to society . Archaeologists have engaged with social theorists to make ontological claims regarding sociocultural phenomena . This approach has yielded many insights, but it seems limited from the perspective of practical relevance in that the approach generally does not lead to predictions that can be evaluated empirically . We should be under no illusions that developing a predictive theory of human society is easy . Archaeologists are good at historical reconstruction, and getting better all the time . From GIS to AMS-dating, isotopes, ICP-MS, micromorphology, phytoliths, ancient DNA, LiDAR and more, archaeological methods continue to expand our ability to reconstruct past human behavior . As these methods expand, our historical narratives become increasingly detailed, accurate, and compelling . The Village Ecodynamics Project (VEP) has worked since 2003 to examine human-environment relationships in the US Southwest . Several centuries of rapid population growth, in the context of a subsistence farming society with a modest division of labor, led to a substantial fraction of the population living on land that was vulnerable to drought . Based on VEP research, it is clear that the social response to drought was far in excess of its actual impact to regional agricultural potential . Social breakdown, characterized by extreme internecine violence and a rejection of existing social institutions, led to mass migration and the end of a cultural tradition . Peter Bergen: Traditional synthesis yields fascinating generalizations, but it is not structured enough to provide more than a starting point for an archaeology with practical relevance . He says cross-cultural analysis is a good example of this style of research . SESHAT project has compiled a global archaeological and historical database and used it to test hypotheses about the underlying structure of variation in human social organization at the level of polities . Archaeologists have been aware of the shortcomings of traditional approaches as a means of generating predictive knowledge of human affairs . The New Archaeology was not successful in its stated aims, but the reasons behind its failure may help archaeology chart a path toward enhanced practical relevance . Archaeologists can certainly do this, but the earlier discussion of history suggests that if the goal of archaeology is to explain the specific event, delving into the details toward historically-contingent factors will be far more productive . Kent Flannery famously derided the initial results as mere “Mickey Mouse laws” (Flannery, 1973), and such critiques led archaeologists to abandon the ultimate goal of the New Archaeology program . The ultimate goal of the New Archaeology was to discover regularities in human social behavior that are context independent, with the implication that they apply to the present as well as the past . This sounds like the kind of knowledge that would contribute to contemporary conversations regarding urban planning, economic development, inequality, sustainability, migration, health, and other issues . When medical researchers test efficacy of a new drug, they typically study three groups: one that receives the treatment, a second that receives a placebo and a third that does not receive a treatment at all . The logic of such studies is that despite the myriad uncontrollable factors that govern outcomes for any given individual, it is still possible to determine the average effect of a single factor across a population . For example, we can predict, with high confidence, that an archaeological site at which a certain variety of pottery is common was occupied during a certain time period . For archaeologists, our potentially relevant units include households, neighborhoods, settlements, polities, ethnic groups, and populations . We do not have a tradition of applying the same techniques we normally apply in everyday analysis and interpretation to the units that matter beyond our field . We need to apply this logic to relevant units of analysis, design and implement appropriate methodologies . The “social reactor process” induces human networks to grow in consistent, non-linear, and open-ended ways with population . As a result, individuals in larger settlements have more social contacts and exchanges per unit time; and there are also increased opportunities for specialization as individuals can meet more of their material needs . SST argues that the average effect of settlement population for an aggregate property of interest is given by a power function . These scalar effects of human networks can be observed empirically by fitting a linear function to log-transformed measures of N and Y across a sample of settlements in a system . The theory also includes mathematical models that derive predictions for what the exponent β should be . The analysis determines whether, on average, the estimated exponent β falls within the range of statistical tolerance of the model . The proxy for a socio-economic rate is the total area of domestic structures (or mounds) in the settlement . We treat the latter as a measure of total settlement productivity based on a variety of archaeological and ethnoarchaeological studies which support an association between house size and wealth . The process by which total house areas are estimated varies substantially across settlements . Figure 1 and Table 1 show that there is a striking regularity in the relationship between settlement population and house area in five New World societies . The slopes of the fit lines capturing the relationship are nearly identical . This uniformity can be made even clearer by centering the data from each region . The average rate of gain in productivity with increasing settlement population is within two one-thousandths of the predicted value . This result provides striking support for the model . In the contemporary world the height of a scaling relationship generally increases from year to year . Social Reactors Project suggests that, at least with respect to population size, human agglomeration effects are highly predictable . This does not necessarily mean that doubling the size of a given city today would necessarily increase its per capita socio-economic rates by 16.7 percent . Settlement scaling models generate testable predictions that are borne out in many datasets, using a variety of measures . Urban geographers are beginning to interrogate some of the assumptions and results of settlement scaling research more closely . Middle-range theory continues to provide a basis for constructing valid proxies for human behavior that researchers outside of archaeology will find relevant . As a result, knowledge of the social reactor process emanating from archaeological research should be relevant for urban science and urban policy .

How data analysis can enrich the liberal arts | The Economist,"In 1941 Father Roberto Busa started noting down as many uses of the word “in” as he could find in the Latin work of Thomas Aquinas, a medieval theologian and saint . By 1980, when his team finally printed the “Index Thomisticus’s” in 56 volumes, they had spooled through 1,500km (930 miles) of tape . The final product compresses Homer, Sophocles and Plato into 2.5GB of tidy Extensible Markup Language (XML), complete with the grammatical properties of each word . Researchers have been trying to do that from almost the time when Father Busa began punching cards . Ted Underwood took nearly 100,000 novels from 1800-2009 and an algorithm that apportions nouns, adjectives and verbs to specific characters . He found that women received about 50% of descriptions in 1800, but barely 30% by 1950 . Victorian characters often agonised over inheritance or debt, such as reckless Fred Vincy in ‘Middlemarch’ The rate at which authors referenced specific amounts of cash nearly doubled in that period (see chart 3) The median amount mentioned fell from nearly 60% of annual income to less than 5% .

Where to Start? On Research Questions in The Digital Humanities | Trevor Owens,"Jason Heppler suggested that one should “Fit the tool to the question, not the other way around” in terms of working with new digital humanities tools . The purpose of research questions in the humanities is to clarify what is in and out of scope in a project . Research questions are useful structures to organize your work and inquiry and are valuable tools for signifying to others what to expect from a piece of scholarship . Research question are functionally an attempt to establish the set of criteria by which a piece of scholarship should be evaluated . Joe Maxwell’s approach, there are five components of research design as it is actually practiced . The main point of the diagram, is that your research questions should be iteratively revised and refined . Every attempt to answer a question comes with inherent theoretical assumptions about the problem . This is true of method broadly conceived; every method for collecting sources/evidence, the original intent by which records and sources are collected create silences . All tools, archives and research questions are in and of themselves instrumental .",http://www.trevorowens.org/2014/08/where-to-start-on-research-questions-in-the-digital-humanities/,0,Scrapes v3,

JSTOR,"JSTOR Labs is working with Canterbury Christ Church University to create a new interdisciplinary site for people researching the county of Kent in the southeast of England . Carolyn Oulton was interested in creating a site that would allow users, for example, to trace the footsteps of both Dickens and his characters in the region . Kent Maps Online was born of a fascination with untold stories and forgotten things . It features canonical authors, quite a few of them in fact . But it also makes space for the obscure and out of print, the overtly populist and the downright odd . It breaks down boundaries between historic and fictional characters . JSTOR Labs asked us to write mini-stories about characters who might stumble across the site . The turning point came when we realised that we didn't want this to be just a showcase for a body of research – what we were building was a creative research tool that could be used by anyone at any stage of their career .

Digital Humanities and the Discontents of Meaning | Journal of Chinese History 中國歷史學刊 | Cambridge Core,"The digital humanities offer more than just a set of tools, but offer compelling ways of thinking about meaning within that impasse . Digital humanities live within the impasse of the failure of language that has long shadowed humanistic study . The problem of the retreat of reference has deep roots in the Western philosophical tradition, with the vanishing of reference to ground meaning, we have been forced to confront the question: if the world does not shape the structure of language, then what does? The movement toward “postcritique” discussed by Rita Felski and others is an important index of the discontents of meaning . Geoffrey Harpham, the former director of the National Humanities Center, lamented in 2006: “One of the most striking features of contemporary intellectual life is the fact that questions formerly reserved for the humanities are today being approached by scientists in various disciplines such as cognitive science, cognitive neuroscience, robotics, artificial life, behavioral genetics and evolutionary biology . Humanists must welcome these developments as offering a new grounding for their own work . The digital humanities play a critical role in the gradual opening up of the humanities to the broader interpretation of the human . The sciences can help us understand the biological mechanisms of memory, affect, and language production . But situating and understanding texts within the human world built upon these basic processes return us to the discipline of hermeneutics . In topic modeling, one begins with a collection of texts . In the most common approach, the order of the words does not matter, and each document is considered simply an unordered “bag of words . The goal of topic modeling is to build a system of mutual differentiation relying only on the collection of the bag of words in the corpus . Topic modeling is a form of distributional semantics in which the meaning of words are defined through the patterns of their usage within a corpus . Some authors relate this meaning-as-usage to Ludwig Wittgenstein's famous dictum “For a large class of cases of the employment of the word ‘meaning’—though not for all—this word can be explained in this way . Wittgenstein arrived at his view of language when he confronted the failure of the more substantive model of traditional philosophy . His account, in other words, is anti-foundational: it rejects the possibility that human access to objects can serve as the foundation of knowledge and of language . The world into which we are born and in which we live is shaped by the long history of intentional human structuring, and we learn to speak, act and think through the mediation of these humanly shaped forms . Because we share these forms, we understand one another . Hermeneutics has always defended the certainty of understanding against historical skepticism and wilful subjectivity . It has also provided theoretical foundations for the confident progress of philology and history by Schlegel, Schleiermacher and Boeckh . Schleiermacher was part of the group of early German Romantic writers who were endeavoring to respond to Immanuel Kant's critical philosophy . Kant argued that not only do we not have access to objects in the world; we do not have inner access to our own self as the ground for experience . Schleermacher considered them to be as shaped by the same constraints of time and place as all other provisional human knowledge . The project of the digital humanities in our own day, with our own epistemological problematic, is a continuation of Schleiermacher's infinite project of understanding . He argues that one makes progressively greater sense of fragments one does know through the sorts of intuitions without rules . Close reading opens out when we see the text as the locus of synthesis for all the myriad patterns disclosed by distant readings of which the text is a part . Stylometry for Classical Chinese is still a work in progress, but we can sharpen its techniques as we explore the rise and complex dispersions of genres . The goal of presenting a systematic analysis of the “human sphere” informing life in premodern China drives the China Biographical Database project . We are acutely aware of data that we cannot collect and the limits of what we offer . Richard Hartwell created the initial database in dBase, an old database programming language . Hartwell designed his database to look at the connection between office-holding and kinship . He says it allows scholars to explore their interactions in a corollary to Schleiermacher's proposed methodology . Schleiermacher and Dilthey were circumspect and methodical in their efforts to allow contemporary readers to understand the lived significance of texts of the past . But new digital technologies allow us to extend the range of our data and our ability to organize it in ways that they could not have imagined . Humanists have much to contribute to this project that we share with scholars pursuing other forms of inquiry . We have a great future if we open ourselves to the challenges of this shared endeavor .",https://cup.org/3bwNaWu,0,Scrapes v3,
"Feminism, Activism, and the Digital Humanities: An Interview with Danica Savonick | HASTAC","Dr. Danica Savonick discusses the transformative power and potential risks of using digital technologies in the classroom . Her considerations remain all too relevant as teachers continue to adapt to the online classroom . HASTAC has taught me a lot about audience and how to write about complex research in a way that is exciting and engaging and will keep someone wanting to read even if they are exhausted after a long day of teaching . This interdisciplinary audience forces you not to use jargon and also to provide vivid, tangible examples . Digital humanities is bringing attention to some of the things that feminists have actually been doing and saying for years . It's interesting how a contemporary online network like HASTAC has shaped my archival and historical research on feminist pedagogy . How do you think the digital humanities can serve as a radical feminist space for teachers? Digital humanities has brought attention to the fact that research can take the format of a timeline or a website, or a podcast . At its best, digital platforms can help us nurture students’ activist sensibilities: that idea that when you see a problem in society, how can you use whatever skills, resources, knowledge that you have access to in order to address that problem? Digital technologies often exacerbate existing inequalities in society, but also can be used to promote equity . HASTAC helped circulate Brandon Bayne’s “adjusted syllabus” as we abruptly moved online last spring . Now is so not the time to prove a point about rigor or productivity . Through archival research on syllabi, lesson plans, and assignments, the project explores the reciprocal relations between teaching and writing in their work . I'm hoping that by sharing some of their stories, we can think more deeply about the collective value of learning, not just for individuals, but for the collective flourishing of our society .",https://www.hastac.org/blogs/rebekahjoa/2021/01/07/feminism-activism-and-digital-humanities-interview-danica-savonick,0,Scrapes v3,
Archaeology is going digital to harness the power of Big Data | Ars Technica,"Archaeology is catching up with the so-called ""digital humanities"" A special edition of the Journal of Field Archaeology looks at the impact of large-scale data archives and analytics on archaeological research . The papers were originally presented during a special session at a 2019 meeting of the Society for American Archaeology . Steven Wernke and Parker VanValkenburgh discuss the importance of using digital tools of Big Data . They say they're not trying to replace field-collected data as the ""gold standard"" for field work, but complementing that with new tools for turning old imagery into things that we can put online and search systematically . The other dimension has to do with documenting archaeological heritage at a time when it's disappearing at an accelerating rate . Archaeologists tend to specialize geographically and they tend to get to know a place intimately . VanValkenburgh: We're hyper-conscious of the fact that this kind of godlike view you get from viewing the surface of the earth from everywhere and nowhere at once brings with it a lot of risk . GeoPACHA is a big data challenge that encompasses over five modern republics in today's terms, millions of people and dozens of ethnolinguistic groups . It is crowdsourced in that many people are working on it, but it's not just wide-open crowdsourcing . VanValkenburgh: ""The traditional narrative is Spanish conquest, with a capital C. We're trying to complicate that narrative"" VanValkenburgh: ""We need to have a serious conversation about the ethics and best practices of doing big archaeology"" He says cooperation and ethical introspection are the two things I think are most important . Vanvalkenburg: There's two parallel tracks in terms of data aggregation that are going on right now . Archaeologist working in a local community is beholden to personal relationships in a way that you don't necessarily get when you're working as an eye in the sky . So I think we're entering a more contemplative phase of archaeological science .",https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/archaeology-is-going-digital-to-harness-the-power-of-big-data/,0,Scrapes v3,
Opening the ‘black box’ of digital cultural heritage processes: feminist digital humanities and critical heritage studies | UCL UCLDH Blog,"A clear relationship exists between digital humanities and digital cultural heritage more broadly, perhaps the most facile and wide-ranging of examples being the digitisation of heritage texts and materials . But there has been comparatively little recognition of (digital) heritage as a socially constructed phenomenon – the raison d’être of CHS – within DH . Feminist DH and gender CHS share a concern with the false and learned assumptions about objectivity and neutrality, and the way that power and social roles are performed, valued and devalued through technology and heritage . We suggest digital heritage as a critical bridging point between these areas of shared concern .

"LiteratureGeek.com: A Digital Humanities What, Why, & How (DLF eResearch Network Talk) A Digital Humanities What, Why, & How (DLF eResearch Network Talk) | Literature Geek","Digital humanities takes the work already done in the humanities, but does it in digital ways . It’s as much about a distinct community and its values, as it is about DH methods and output . A DHer might think through what a feminist social media platform would look like . DH can look like many kinds of methods and/or publication forms, and those methods should be inclusive of all kinds of critical thinking and contributions to shared knowledge . It’s up to the practitioner in question to identify whether they, their project, and their methods “are DH” There are reasons to apply the term DH other than boundary-defining . I define DH in part by a willingness to partner with and borrow from all other fields . If we all had to tirelessly adhere to rules all the time or be cast out of DH, we wouldn’t have anyone in the field . Digital humanities isn’t so much focused “just” on digitizing things . Digitization is a DH method, and is often crucial, scholarly work; it’s just that digitization (or coding, or whatever other method you want to think through) is in no way all of what DH does . One of the trends I’m seeing in DH is a move from making things public, to making things participatory . 10-20 years ago, there was a big emphasis on just getting transcripts and scans of texts and images online . Now, we may want to ask, what do DHers care about? And how can we encourage others to care about the same thing, when that’s appropriate? Documenting the Now is a DH project building ethical tools for preserving and including social media activism in the archive, with a focus on #BlackLivesMatter and related hashtags . DocNow is building a community around the difficult questions of ethically and respectfully creating a historical record of protests . One of my DH projects is a website that supports collaboratively reading and interpreting a really difficult novel, James Joyce’s Ulysses . The goal of the project was to look at ways we can use visual and community design to invite, welcome, support, and value the contributions of non-academics in the conversations around challenging literary texts . The #TransformDH hashtag and Tumblr are working on tackling problems in the field . The #MyDHis hashtag captures people speaking about their visions for what DH should value . The yearly DH conference last week drew 902 participants from 45 countries, but diverse representation is lagging behind . The DH I’ve encountered is open to rethinking how what we value as scholars can look, given today’s knowledge and opportunities . Not everyone is or wants to be called a digital humanist or a scholar or a researcher . Many DH projects are necessarily collaborative, because they require many skills and no one person is likely to offer expertise for each . You can work in DH without needing to do everything yourself, and without being an expert in coding or digital method; maybe your contribution is historical knowledge, or being great at locating information online . DHers use the term “alt-ac” (#altac) to refer to “alternative academic” positions . Being part of this community means you can use platforms like Twitter and Slack to get real-time feedback . Sometimes you’re able to focus on and reach much wider audiences than traditional scholarship allows . Often humanities PhDs come out of their dissertations without being aware of career options other than tenure-track teaching . At the university level, DH’s emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, methodologies over content, will help us connect libraries and liberal arts units to other campus communities including STEM departments . It might not seem like a big deal to be aware of related types of job if you’re coming from library science . If you have a project idea that needs funding, DH funders including Mellon, the NEH (National Endowment for the Humanities) often post example grant proposals or successful past proposals . The DH Slack has a number of channels (or themed chatrooms) for asking any level of DH question, for students wanting to discuss fitting DH into their studies . If you run into trouble with someone preventing you from doing DH work, you can help you argument in a couple ways . It can also help to assemble a list of precedents for your work . A lot of the rejection of digital scholarship hinges on it being “different” from non-digital scholarship . Big thanks to Élika Ortega and Stewart Varner for changing how I present on and define DH . #DHdiversity, #MyDHis, #WhatIfDH, #TransformDH are also awesome and have helped me be a better DHer .",http://literaturegeek.com/2016/07/21/dlf-digital-humanities-what-why-how,0,Scrapes v3,

"Iantorno | GameSound, Quantitative Games Analysis, and the Digital Humanities |
  Digital Studies / Le champ numérique","This paper outlines Michael Iantorno’s experiences with quantitative game analysis by summarizing the first year of development of the prototype ludomusicological database GameSound . It also analyzes the work of fellow digital humanities scholar Jason Bradshaw, who applied intriguing types of tool-based analysis to BioShock Infinite . The paper hypothesizes where this type of research could lead in the future . By accessing game assets directly, rather than solely through play, we believe that scholars have the opportunity to analyze videogames in new ways . We developed GameSound as a prototype ludomusicological database, with the intent of providing users with easy access to the music and sound effects present within videogames . Using Civilization IV as a case study and HEURIST to build the database, GameSound currently provides access to over 2000 sound effect files . GameSound is our first foray into this type of research, originally conceived as a digital humanities class assignment at McGill University . We believe the database has potential academic, professional, and hobbyist applications . We describe GameSound as a tool for enabling new types of quantitative videogame analysis . GameSound aims to facilitate access to a videogame’s audio elements without having to rely on playthroughs or secondary resources . GameSound users have the freedom to access audio through faceted searches, create custom reports, and embed content on the web for easy collaboration . GameSound allows scholars to listen directly to sound effects or music from a videogame, enabling approaches such as Michel Chion’s conception of reduced listening . The initial dataset focuses entirely on the sounds found within the 2005 computer game Civilization IV . GameSound’s faceted search functionality allows users to explore Civilization IV audio files through a web browser . Users can search for a specific piece of audio by filename, or simply sift through the list-view . Users are able to export customized reports that contain entries determined by parameters that exist within the database . There is a notable lack of academic tools that can penetrate these layers, and most of the existing software used to extract audio and game code falls squarely into the realm of modding or hobbyism . As GameSound was not created with a specific research project in mind, much of the initial data gathering was speculative in nature . Data types were selected for practical reasons, as much of their extraction could be automated . In-game actions may trigger dialogue, sound effects, music, and ambient sounds directly (by clicking a button in the interface) or indirectly (through timed events or algorithms) The IEZA classification system acknowledges the uniqueness of game audio while encapsulating it within a simple set of database parameters . Database updates will focus around the acquisition of audio assets from a game, followed by a sorting process . This fresh infusion of data will offer new opportunities for introspection and revision . The database may be altered or completely rebuilt to include new categories or search functionality .

Data Fail: Teaching Data Literacy with African Diaspora Digital Humanities / Data Fail: Teaching Data Literacy with African Diaspora Digital Humanities – The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy,"What can data visualization tell us about the scope and spread of Pan-Africanism during the first half of the 20th century? These questions were at the heart of a directed study during the 2019–2020 academic year . African diaspora digital humanities offers students opportunities to engage in active learning through participation in civically engaged scholarship . Such forms of authentic learning are “participatory, experimental, and carefully contextualized via real-world applications, situations, or problems” The Digital Black Atlantic (University of Minnesota Press, 2021), which Risam co-edited with Kelly Baker Josephs for the Debates in the Digital Humanities series, will be the first volume . The directors compiled data sets from their partners identifying the locations where Black writers and artists found themselves throughout the twentieth century and created data visualizations that show their intersections . The project opens up new research questions about relationships and collaborations between them . The possibility of creating new avenues of transnational research is perhaps the most critical contribution of African diaspora digital humanities projects . Risam and Mahoney set out to identify connections between attendees at Pan-Africanist events . Data set reveals rich global connections and world travel that brought Black people of the US, Caribbean, Europe, and Africa into communication and collaboration during first half of 20th century . Researchers spent months digging into the history of Pan-Africanism, using monographs, journal articles, digital archives, theses and dissertations, historic Black newspapers, organization newsletters, and primary source documents from the events . A single event often appears under multiple names, a factor of the relative lack of attention in academic discourse . Researchers identified close to seventy events within their timeframe that fit criteria of explicitly creating space for Pan-African connections among Black participants from around the world . The data set was itself a scholarly activity, using both primary and secondary sources to validate the existence of lesser-known gatherings . Some of the same participants were listed under different names in multiple sources, requiring additional research to verify . In other cases, delegates had changed their names, which was not unusual at the time . Differences in non-Anglophone names reflected divergent transliteration practices . Digital humanists, after all, are not unaccustomed to encountering failure and pivoting with research questions and methods to see what these methods make possible (Dombrowski 2019; Graham 2019) Two maps show the geographic scope of Pan-Africanism and its growth and spread over the first sixty years of the 20th century . Data visualizations are representations that slice and sample data sets, showing particular aspects of the data . Mahoney and Nassereddine found the experience an instructive lesson in how to teach humanities students to engage with data . Risam used this project to encourage students to move away from assumptions and be open to the new insights that emerge from a challenge . The project also led Mahoney to realize that often we are left with more questions than answers . Amy Ashwood Garvey arguably played a more significant role in Pan-Africanism than her husband . Ashwood Garvey organized the Fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester, England, in 1945 . He says the relative lack of scholarly attention that Pan-Africaism has received in spite of its significance is a reflection of the biases within the cultural record and curriculum that favor knowledge production on canonical histories, figures, and movements of the Global North . Reading and analyzing data sets and data visualization is a cross-disciplinary skill that needs to be incorporated across the curriculum . English Language Arts teachers have a responsibility to ensure that students are prepared to understand data, as a cornerstone of literacy . Teaching data literacy holds the possibility of appealing to students who might struggle with or be less interested in literature .",https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/data-fail-teaching-data-literacy-with-african-diaspora-digital-humanities/,0,Scrapes v3,

He is a logician and a long-time ICT enthusiast . He has been involved in several ICT-related projects since the early 1990s . He also has seen a lot of the changes that we have experienced with the development of the web . In 2002, the University of Flanders started with Toledo, the Blackboard e-learning platform . My vision was from the start that ICT should always support core processes of a business . In many faculties, with regard to online teaching, that was really not their cup of tea – they were not interested . Linguistics was the first to embrace digital methods in the Faculty of Arts and the Computer Linguistic department . Digital heritage is not about putting nice collections online, it is transforming how a heritage institution works from the start to the finish . In the other disciplines, it took a long time to embrace computational humanities . The first big project on Europeana photography, where we – together with the KU Leuven Libraries – delivered about half a million images to Europeana. That was really one of the nicest projects. I still like e-learning and I am still involved in everything that has to do . Professor of Digital Humanities says pedagogy must be a constant challenge to keep up with new tools and environments coming up all the time . His favorite part of teaching is working with students in the Advanced Master’s in digital Humanities . In the past, people in the humanities got courses in logic, but now, it’s ages ago that this has been culled . The worst grade that I received as a first year student in the Faculty of Arts was for “historical methods ” I think I even had to retake the exam! The Advanced Master’s in Digital Humanities programme would like to have a short class on how the internet works . The course is still taught in the history programme for the Bachelor students in the Faculty of Arts . Digital Humanities as a separate research field, for me is in fact the continuation of Library Studies, and the function and that the library always had in the work of science . For example, algebra and logical reasoning, those should maybe be taken up again throughout secondary school . There is also this absolute drama that the teaching of Latin is winding down, whereas most of the teaching . Digital Humanities is a way to grasp what we are doing in the humanities, and can develop methodologies that advance history science, or literature science, and for that you need insight that changes the way we see things . Humanities scholars are very well versed in doing this, and should take up this role . Digital methods will be a standard part of mainstream Humanities research . Digital tools will be developed to support these processes . Digital methods are becoming visible in leading Humanities academic journals .

"Bloomsbury Collections - Electronic Literature as Digital Humanities - Contexts, Forms, & Practices","In this chapter, we offer a survey of electronic literature that deals with embodiment, corporeality, and body image in aesthetic and material ways . We explore body-themed, feminist e-lit in theory and practice . We argue that female-coded bodies have been pitched against patriarchal neoliberalist appearance culture and positioned to challenge reader-players’ expectations of bodily playability in digital media . The Breathing Wall aestheticizes the anatomical and site-specific double-situatedness of the reading body . Bot poetry has become an intrinsic element of contemporary e-literary culture . An e-lit work that plays with cybersomatic AI in humorous and thought-provoking ways is Serge Bouchardon’s Storyface app . Fitting the Pattern shifts the focus onto the instrumentality and materiality of bodily construction . In her Flash fiction Underbelly (2010), Wilks takes on the historical theme of women working in British coal mines . She juxtaposes their physical suffering with the physical work of a twenty-first-century Yorkshire sculptor . Digital media allows us to stylize our digital bodies as idealized representations of our narcissism, customizable through on-screen avatars . In digital media, we can experiment with our forms and those of others . These refashionings can leave our bodies simultaneously liberated and “alienated from themselves, augmented thanks to technology, modified, reincarnated, multiplied” The Mulvean, binarist male gaze, which assumes that women are the passive object of the active, male voyeur, has been modulated and augmented throughout the history of visual culture . In body-themed works of e-literature (and other forms of digital-interactive narrative), by contrast, this mediated distance is minimized or seemingly erased by a material, symbolically permeable interface between the body of the voyeur and the body on screen . ‘Ne me touchez pas’ is a phenomenological concept of presence that reflects the mutual incorporation of player and game, of reader and digital-born text . Giovanna di Rosario highlights the works of María Mencía as powerful attempts at developing “a new poetic form of language” that are independent of the conversational conventions of patriarchy . The WNB co-designers shared a desire for an intervention that could rupture the usual restrictive, binary ways in which we come to understand our bodies .

Can artificial intelligence transform higher education? | International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education | Full Text,"The International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education volume 17, Article number: 42 (2020) The aim of this edition is to examine the potential and actual impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on teaching and learning in higher education . Only four of the 23 articles were considered appropriate for publication, based on academic quality . The special edition edition of this issue of this edition includes four articles on the potential and actual impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on higher education . From these 146 articles, they were able to identify four key areas of AI applications for teaching and learning . The main impact has been on the prediction of student success or failure . There was no valid evidence of improved learning outcomes, or radical, or even tangential pedagogical changes resulting from AI applications . There is little evidence of a major breakthrough in the application of ‘modern’ AI specifically to teaching and learning, in higher education, with the exception of perhaps learning analytics . Most AI developments for teaching and learning – or at least the research papers – are by computer scientists, not educators . Lynch (2017) argues that if AI is going to benefit education, it will require strengthening the connection between AI developers and experts in the learning sciences . He argues that to develop the high level intellectual skills of critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving, and emotional skills such as empathy . Zawacki-Richter et al. pointedly ask: where are the educators? Most research on AI in Higher Education appears to have been done by computer scientists . Their focus is in the tools, the algorithms, and their validity and application, rather than the impact on learning outcomes . Each student is an individual and will respond slightly differently from others in the same context . Students often learn better when they feel that the instructor or teacher cares . Chatbots are one way to do this; machine learning and visualisation techniques also have potential . The key lesson from all AI developments is that we will need to pay increased attention to the affective and emotional aspects of life in a robotic-heavy society . The good news is that, used in this way, AI supports teachers and instructors, but does not replace them . Are higher education institutions in a good position to redefine the power relationship in this data intensive world? The education community will need to be re-educated to work under the 'new normal' It is increasingly evident that AI can play an important role in reducing time and effort to conduct administrative tasks . The rapid development of digital technologies has outstripped the capacity of humans to develop the prerequisite digital competencies to navigate in this context . The challenge seems to be enabling higher education to emerge fully into the world of AI without compromising its core principles and values . It will be critical that higher education institutions become agile learning organisations capable of quickly adopting new practices and dynamics . These are indeed existential questions if AI does become immensely successful in reducing the costs of teaching and learning: but at what cost to us as humans? Fortunately AI is not yet in a position to provide such a threat, but this will not always be the case .

“Chapter 9: Why Are the Digital Humanities So White? or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation | Tara McPherson” in “Debates in the Digital Humanities” on Debates in the DH Manifold,"American Studies Association hosted its annual conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in October 2008 . The ASA has emerged as a leading venue for vibrant discussions about race, ethnicity, transnationalism, gender, and sexuality . The conference included remarkably little discussion of digital technologies . Many members of ASA treat computation within the humanities with some level of suspicion, perceiving it to be complicit with the corporatization of higher education or as primarily technological rather than scholarly . This essay will argue that we desperately need to close the gap between these two modes of inquiry . The difficulties we encounter in knitting together our discussions of race with our technological productions within the digital humanities are actually an effect of the very designs of our technological systems . The mid-1960s also saw the origins of the American Indian Movement (AIM) and the launch of the National Organization for Women (NOW) The late 1960s mark the 1968 citywide walkouts of Latino youth in Los Angeles, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy . The two fragments typically stand apart in parallel tracks, attracting the interest and attention of very different audiences . As one delves into the intricacies of UNIX, race in America recedes far from our line of vision and inquiry . New media scholars have noted parallels between ways of knowing modeled in computer culture and structuralism and poststructuralism . Michael Omi and Howard Winant argue that racial formations serve as fundamental organizing principles of social relations in the U.S. Omi: How might we understand the infusion of racial organizing principles into the technological organization of knowledge after World War II? A lenticular logic is a covert racial logic, a logic for the post–civil rights era . It structures representations but also epistemologies . It also serves to secure our understandings of race in very narrow registers, fixating on sameness or difference . Computers from 1940 to 1960 had “complex, interdependent designs,” and they label this era the “premodular” phase of computing . Complexity in UNIX is controlled in part by the Rule of Modularity, which insists that code be constructed of discrete and interchangeable parts . The tool library that is being envisioned is a series of discrete and specific tools or programs that can operate independently of one another . In effect, the tools chunk computational programs into isolated bits where the programs’ operations are meant to be “invisible to the user” and to other programs in a sequence . The ability to construct a pipeline from a series of small programs evolved, while the “hiding of internals” was also supported . Pipes reduced complexity and were also linear . The contents of a module were not central to the functioning of the pipeline; rather, the input or output (a text stream) was key . UNIX, in the words of one account, “embraces multiple languages, open extensible systems and customization hooks everywhere,” reading much like a description of the tenets of neoliberal multiculturalism (Raymond, 24) Another rule of UNIX is the Rule of Diversity, which insists on a mistrust of the “one true way” Identity politics emerged in the 1960s as a kind of social and political embrace of modularity and encapsulation, a mode of partitioning that turned away from the broader forms of alliance-based and globally inflected political practice that characterized both labor politics and antiracist organizing in the 1930s and 1940s . Many shifts were enacted in the name of liberalism, aimed at distancing the overt racism of the past even as they contained and cordoned off progressive radicalism . Gerald Graff has examined the “patterned isolation” that emerges in the university after World War II . Graff locates the beginning of this patterned isolation in the run-up to the period that also brought us digital computing . Many now lament the overspecialization of the university; in effect, this tendency is a result of the additive logic of the lenticular . Lev Manovich has noted the modularity of the digital era and also backtracked to early twentieth-century examples of modularity from the factory line to the creative productions of avant garde artists . Lev: Many of the methodologies of the humanities from the cold war through the 1980s also privilege text while devaluing context and operate in their own chunked systems . Lev says modularity emerged in our systems with such a vengeance across the 1960s . The core principles of modularity that UNIX helped bring into practice continue to impact a wide range of digital computation, especially the C programming language, developed for UNIX by Ritchie, based on Thompson's earlier B language . Digital humanities and code studies are taking up the challenge of understanding how computational systems developed and operate . They must also take up the questions of culture and meaning that animate so many scholars of race in fields like the new American studies . There is tendency in film and media studies to treat the computer and its screens as a “legacy” technology to cinema . For most of the twentieth century, cinema was a profoundly visual (if also aural) form, with images etched into celluloid . Yet to trouble my own polemic, we might understand the workings of code to have internalized the visual to the extent that, in the heart of the labs from which UNIX emerged, the cultural processing of the visual via the register of race was already at work in the machine . In universities that shut down “old school’s” departments, they must engage digital forms that make us nervous . We need to be literate in emerging scientific and technological methodologies but also in theories of race, globalization, and gender . We must remember that computers are themselves encoders of culture . This essay is a revised version of a piece originally written for Race after the Internet, edited by Peter Chow-White and Lisa Nakamura . Feedback from Neil Fraistat, Matt Gold, David Golumbia, and Steve Ramsay helped sharpen the piece for this volume . Some scholars have questioned the neutral status of digital structures such as code and databases . John Unsworth has situated UNIX as a Western cultural formation, arguing that “UNIX is deeply indebted to culturally determined notions such as private property, class membership, and hierarchies of power and effectivity . For oppressed groups, common sense may allow a method of speaking back to power and of rejiggering what counts as sensible . My Reconstructing Dixie examines the ways in which a lenticular logic infects identity politics and the politics of difference, making productive alliance and relationality hard to achieve in either paradigm . I argue that a broad cultural turn to modularity and encapsulation was both a response to these earlier political alliances and a way to short circuit their viability in the 1960s . The author suggests that perhaps this very resistance might itself be an after effect of the triumph of modularity in the contemporary academy . He says the resistance to modularity might be due to the triumph in the academy . The author offers his views on the philosophy of the modern digital humanities .

"John Branca on Michael Jackson, legacy, and the music industry","MBW's World’s Greatest Managers series profiles the best artist managers in the global business . This time, we speak to John Branca, who as well as managing the legacy of Michael Jackson, is also a top music attorney . Branca has successfully fought – and won – landmark battles on behalf of creators that have set into motion a sustained change in the remuneration of artists and songwriters . Michael Jackson bought ATV Music Publishing for just $47. 5m in 1985 . The deal netted Jackson the rights to The Beatles' song catalog . Sony acquired Jackson Estate’s 50% shareholding in Sony/ATV in 2016 . Michael Branca represented Michael Jackson in 1980 . Branca and his partners David Lande and David Byrnes represent Beyoncé, Travis Scott, Pharrell Williams, Enrique Iglesias, Justin Timberlake, and Shakira . He is currently waging a legal war against the Emmy-winning HBO documentary, Leaving Neverland . Backstreet Boys were signed to Lou Pearlman, and maybe been paid at best $2m or $3m – clearly unfair . Justin Timberlake and several other artists we have gotten them out of onerous contracts, emancipating them from difficult contracts . ‘I’ve always been an artist / independent label / songwriter representative . When Michael Jackson died in 2009, the deal with Sony – our distribution deal – was almost up . We were able to secure for Michael ownership for all of his master recordings and his videos . ‘The big artists have more leverage than ever. ” Artists need to give some thought in their estate planning, as to who they appoint to represent their estates and carry on their legacy . ‘I’m not that prescient and would defer to the prognosticators. There are some very smart people and companies that are able to forecast future trends. But I will say this, though: Roger Daltrey once famously said, 'I hope I die before I get old.’ Mijac owns some of the greatest copyrights in the history of popular music – things like People Get Ready, Ain’t No Stopping Us Now, When A Man Loves a Woman, and Great Balls of Fire, as well as classic Ray Charles songs . Branca: ""Deadly, deceased artists have no protection under the libel laws, which is completely unfair and must change"" ""It’s shocking that AT&T and HBO would do that,"" Branca says . ""Michael Jackson fired me in 1990, and I didn’t want my career to be over yet,"" he says . It’s important for artists to take a leadership role in society and stand up for what's right . I’d like to see it more about standing up for principles and ideals, social justice, and less about ego and self-aggrandisement .",https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/john-branca-artists-need-to-pay-attention-to-their-legacy-and-be-very-specific-about-it/,0,Scrapes v3,

"‘The youth in Africa are ready to jump the digital divide, they just need to have access and the right price point.’ - Music Business Worldwide","David Alexander is the founder of South Africa-based Sheer Publishing, which was acquired by Downtown Music Holdings earlier this year . The acquisition will see Sheer and Downtown develop new services specifically designed for the needs of African creators . In the early ’90s in South Africa there were two MROs who competed with each other and that allowed the music users to get favourable pricing by playing them off against one another . Today we get over 300 members turning up in person and more than that via proxy because the members realise the value of their participation . The move to digital has brought inequality in the value of international over domestic repertoire due to many factors, such as availability of electricity, access to broadband and cost of data . The model currently in use by some platforms involves complex algorithms that calculate royalties based on the geographic location where the streaming occurs . There has been a flurry of deals with African players and the majority seem to be founded in the shared belief of the value of the African creators . Africa only accounts for less than 1% of global music revenues (according to CISAC) Tech entrepreneurs are rushing to supply ‘free’ wifi via high orbit balloon or satellite . Data on the rest of the African continent is already much cheaper than in South Africa .

Out of 61 countries that report in the IFPI’s [annual global] report, only one is from Africa . Fuse ODG has nearly 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify – that's significant .

Audius has raised nearly $10m for its Spotify rival. Can its blockchain-based model change the game for artist payments? - Music Business Worldwide,"The economics of music streaming is currently under scrutiny in the UK thanks to an ongoing Government inquiry . The CEOs of Universal, Sony and Warner appeared before Parliament on January 19 for a headline-grabbing evidence session . New streaming services are pledging to offer more choices via seemingly ethical ways for fans to listen to music . Unlike major players like Spotify, Audius the company doesn’t exist to make a profit — investors are instead investing into the cryptographic token . Rumburg: ‘Our company exists to build these open source tools and put them out to the world' A network-wide streaming rate is voted into place by the community and artists can choose to be at or below that . The user would not be prompted to pay every time they click play — they’d either top up a pre-paid balance every so often or pay for a recurring subscription to the whole network . Audius wants to marry the streaming user experience with a fan club offering . There’s a lot more data available to the artists in terms of who they should be targeting . But also, our hope is that as a user, you can earn your way into that fan club, too . Audius will always be niche offerings when the major platforms already have so much traction . It would be obvious to assume that Audius, alongside other streaming platforms that are offering a more ethical way of remunerating artists, will always remain niche offerings . We see ourselves as being the future place for superfans to come together to hear exclusive music from those artists . Audius is decentralised and operated by a community of people . The company could stop existing or doing anything tomorrow and all of this would keep working, so long as there are artists in the community .

Music Royalties - How to Get Your Share | Ari's Take,"A Berklee College of Music report found that anywhere from 20% to 50% of music royalties don’t make it to their rightful owners . Kobalt calculated that there are over 900,000 royalty streams per song . In the United States, these are ASCAP, BMI, SESAC and Global Music Rights (GMR) PROs make money to pay songwriter royalties and publishing royalties . PROs split “publishing” and “songwriter” royalties equally equally equally . Global Music Rights (GMR) represents songwriters like Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, Rush, Zac Brown, Hillary Scott of Lady Antebellum, the Avett Brothers, Shirley Caesar, Paul Shaffer and one-half of Thompson Square . GMR has licensed over 33,000 songs with about 100 writers and 200 publishers on their roster . Digital aggregators are how you get your music into Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, YouTube Music, Deezer, Tidal and 80+ other digital stores and streaming services . Admin publishing companies have started popping up over the past few years to help unrepped songwriters (like you and me) collect all their music royalties from around the world . Facebook required creators to have at least 10,000 Page Likes, at least 30,000 one-minute views in the past 60 days . There are music licensing companies and libraries that specialize in issuing inexpensive sync licenses for wedding photographers, corporations and indie filmmakers . Never pay a sync agent money up front to go pitch you . SoundExchange is the only organization in America that collects performance royalties for “noninteractive” digital sound recordings (not compositions) Not all digital radio services work with them . Some opt out and they just negotiate rates directly with each label/distributor . If you are both the performer (artist) and the owner of the sound recording (meaning you don’t have a record label), simply select “Both” on the second page of the registration when it asks you to select: Performer, Sound Recording Copyright Owner or Both . If you live outside the United States, you do NOT need to sign up for SoundExchange . Signup for your country’s “Neighbouring Rights Organization” – see below . Neighbouring rights are similar to what SoundExchange administers and collects (sound recording performance royalties for artists and labels) Outside the U.S. these are from radio (digital and terrestrial), TV, jukeboxes, bars, cafes, shops, night clubs, gyms, universities, and anywhere there is a “public performance” of a recording . You can make music royalties off of any video that uses your sound recording (whether you uploaded the video or not) If you allow YouTube and Facebook to put ads on the video (they call it “monetize”) YouTube splits the ad revenue 45%/55% in your favor . Performance royalties come from plays on the radio (AM/FM or digital), interactive and noninteractive streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, Pandora, YouTube Music, Amazon) Contact SAG-AFTRA directly and give them your info when you have a recording played on a TV commercial . When a movie is played on TV, the songs in that movie earn royalties . Most PROs (like ASCAP, BMI, SOCAN, PRS) have a program where you can import your setlist and venue information to secure payment of your live performance royalties . This can actually be a pretty good chunk of change . An opener of a big arena tour in Europe playing just four songs a night was making about £9,000 per night in performance royalties! If you want to release a cover song (remember, song, not video), you have to get a mechanical license . The U.S. law states that once the song has been publicly released, anyone can cover it, without permission from the copyright owner . It’s best to work with a sync licensing company for this . Songwriters, artists, composers, and representatives receive music royalties from other companies or establishments that want to play their music publicly . It’s a form of compensation for a license that allows public use of the media . When your work gets broadcasted on TV, in public, on the radio, or elsewhere, the Performing Right Society and the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society pay royalties to their members . A sync fee is received by a songwriter (and/or publisher) when a TV show, ad agency, production house, or company purchases a sync license to use a piece of work to synchronize with video .",https://aristake.com/what-is-soundexchange-ascap-bmi-pros-hfa-mechanicals-and-how-to-get-all-your-royalties,0,Scrapes v3,

He moved to London to work for Sanctuary, the management company founded by Iron Maiden’s managers Andy Taylor and Rod Smallwood, and stayed there for the next 21 years .

He was hit especially hard by free filesharing services such as Napster and collapsing album sales . Nile Rodgers remembers feeling anxious for Sanctuary when he visited the label's extravagant new offices . A painful period of downsizing and refinancing wasn't enough to save Sanctuary .

What the major record companies really think about the economics of music streaming - Music Business Worldwide,"Senior executives from Spotify, Apple and Amazon were grilled live on camera by British politicians today in the final session of a UK Parliamentary inquiry into the economics of music streaming . In recent weeks, the UK arms of the major record companies – Universal Music UK, Sony Music UK and Warner Music UK – have filed written submissions with this Parliamentary Committee . Warner Music Group: 'Artists who lose in this scenario are not likely to see this as a more equitable way of dividing payments' Sony Music UK: 'We have to date shared more than $250m from the proceeds of our sale of Spotify shares directly with artists and distributed labels' Warner Music UK says there is no conflict of interest or anti-competitive influence . Labels say streaming should be classified as ‘making available’ – i. e covered by the making available right . The committee asks labels to explain in writing why streaming should count as a ‘sale’ vs. ‘rental’ Universal Music UK: 'Streaming is essentially the internet age form of what was previously a sale' Sony Music UK says streaming falls within the legal definition of the making available right . An individual listener can choose what to play, when to play it, skip forward or replay, create their own curated playlists, indicate whether they like a particular track (which in turn informs algorithmically generated playlists based on the listener’s listening history), and retrieve album or artist information and credits on demand . “Commercially, streaming is substitutable for and has largely replaced physical goods and downloads. ”",https://buff.ly/3aN8IgQ,0,Scrapes v3,

How Superfans Affect Music Business Decisions – Billboard,"Artists are using their most enthusiastic followers to help make key decisions about release dates, tour launches and merch, to spread .

How economics helped me understand the evolving music business - Hypebot,"MusicRadar covered a report released by the University of East Anglia detailing independent musicians’ dwindling incomes . Free market economics is the single most important driver of your business, says Rebecca Day of the Foundation for Economic Education . The Subjective Theory of Value came into play with my music business not too long ago when my band had new music to record but the recording studio we’d been recording at for years had gone up in prices . Many musicians don’t realize taking a continued loss on investment project after project is not a sustainable way to run a business . The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility states that the more units of something someone has, the less value they ascribe to it . Artists are a different kind of entrepreneur because their products are deeply rooted in their emotions and psyche . Artists should hold Reason at the forefront of each business decision we make . Free market will ultimately be what corrects horribly low streaming payouts, incredibly high investment prices, and artists relying on the heart instead of the head to make art profitable, says Rebecca Day .

Islands in the Stream - The American Prospect,"The music industry was once sprawling enough to accommodate a wide spectrum of artists . But artists today are beset on all sides by monopolists and oligopolists . The major labels have been whittled down to three . Record stores, alt-weeklies, and other elements that nurtured local music scenes are largely gone . Streaming has become the industry’s primary revenue source, despite giving a pittance to the vast majority of artists . For the main streaming companies, YouTube and Spotify music is really a loss leader . In the 1990s, music was a $40 billion per year industry; at the peak in the 90s, it was a multimillion-dollar industry . Artists weren’t getting rich, but they could play music and pay the rent, and maybe get a big break . Apple’s digital distribution killed record stores, a node in any local music scene . Record company revenues began a 15-year slump, which filtered down to artists . The labels compensated for the death of the album by sticking their hands in their artists' pockets . The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allowed consolidation across terrestrial radio, with two big networks dominating the airwaves . In a concentrated radio landscape, formats narrowed, diverse artists couldn’t break through, and local content became nonexistent . In place of that offline network that nurtured artists was the internet . YouTube is the largest music streaming platform in the world, accounting for 47 percent of all on-demand play time globally . Before Google bought YouTube in 2006 for just $1.65 billion, it alleged that the site was “a rogue enabler of content theft” An estimate from the Trichordist's most recent Streaming Price Bible shows that YouTube’s Content ID yields $0. 00022 per stream . At that rate, 10,000 streams translates to about $7, less than the price of one album on iTunes . Artists don’t share in their contribution to data collection; that money is generated outside their videos . Spotify gives major labels 18 percent equity in the company in exchange for streaming rights . The service requires users to either listen with ads or pay a subscription fee for ad-free streaming . Spotify also pays out absurdly low per-stream rates, though not as bad as YouTube . Spotify had 345 million monthly active users at the end of 2020 (a 27 percent annual increase) Spotify has outperformed Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Netflix, reaching a market cap of $57.65 billion . Spotify pays 70 percent of all revenue out to artists, and it has almost never turned a profit . In a little over a decade, streaming has swallowed the music industry . Streaming now accounts for 83 percent of all recorded income in the U.S. The pressures of being noticed above the din overtake the instincts of the musician . Spotify appears to be pushing away from music by becoming a podcasting juggernaut . Spotify shut down a live jazz performance podcast that had permission from artists, songwriters, and labels to play their music . Some artists have figured out how to make it work, through a digital-age throwback to the old patronage system . Some musicians doubt these are scalable solutions for anyone without a built-in audience, or for session players who rely on appearance fees, or songwriters who used to make their year by having a credit on a hit record . Rock group Kings of Leon innovated even further, becoming the first to release an album as a non-fungible token, a cryptocurrency bundled with digital art and concert tickets . David Bianculli: A united front of artists could prove key to raising public sympathies against exploitation and toward basic fairness . He says the Live Nation/AEG duopoly funnels revenue to the top: 60 percent of worldwide concert revenue went to top 1 percent of performers in 2017 . The hardest-hit were not the up-and-coming artists trying to break through, but the musical middle class, he says . Live Nation has not hosted a live show in a year and has done about 1,000 ticketed live-stream concerts . Many fear that investors expect the company to capitalize on diminished competition after vaccinations proceed, either through attrition or through a mass buying spree . Music Workers Alliance was formed after the pandemic struck . Save Our Stages legislation secured the biggest federal funding for the arts in U.S. history . NIVA motivated fans to contact Congress, sparking two million emails . Annual U.S. government support for the arts comes in at less than the budget of a Mission: Impossible film . The winds are shifting in Washington around Big Tech, and a united front of artists could prove key to raising public sympathies against exploitation .",https://bit.ly/31rLw2f,0,Scrapes v3,

AI & Music,"We talked to the developers leading the AI revolution in music . Their responses offer a fascinating insight into how future developments could change how we produce and listen to music . Humtap listens to your voice and turns your hums into songs in the style of your favourite artist, in seconds and on the fly on your mobile phone . The app records your hummed melody and chosen rhythm and applies AI algorithms to compose, arrange, perform and produce an instrumental track . CloudBounce are seeking to open up their cloud-based AI processing engine into a new ‘community-driven ecosystem’ known as dBounce . The team’s long-term vision is to provide an online platform for AI-supported music production services . Users will be able to call upon AI services within dBounce to help with pretty much any music production task, including composition, mixing and mastering . Future road map for AI audio services is likely to become increasingly sophisticated and tailored to many different areas . Dr Michael Terrell points to mastering as the “low-hanging fruit” of AI audio production . The dBounce community ecosystem could provide a platform for plug-in manufacturers to draw upon ‘AI audio producers’ to quickly perform production tasks such as mixing . Dror Ayalon, the creator of loop-sharing environment Soundscape, sees AI as augmenting rather than replacing human capabilities . Non-musicians could create music and collaborate with artists and friends, without any musical training, access to skilled producers, studios or money . The benefits of automating repetitive, non-creative ‘functional’ activities are not only relevant to non-musicians but also to seasoned producers . Songwriters could likewise benefit from genre-appropriate, AI-suggested instrumentation or arrangements to help get a song over the line quickly . Dr Michael Terrell's research involves automating mundane tasks such as setting level balance and basic panning and EQ in order to allow musicians to focus on being musicians . Dr Terrell suggests that AI tools could, in effect, act as an interface between the user and the standard DAW toolset . As algorithms become more widely available, AI may enable us to define the level of control we want over our production . We can still have lots of complexity and flexibility if we want it, but we can also choose easier and more immediate results with more decisions made for us . Amper Music are working with artists and sound engineers to help them do what they do . They are not looking to replace anyone, but build tools that can make them do amazing things . LANDR talks about future opportunities for professional producers to train dBounce to become an AI audio producer . Pascal Pilon: “When we launched this thing [LANDR] our slogan was that we work for musicians. Our view was never to prevent engineers from making a living. It should free up people to actually be able to make the music they want to make, without these technical burdens that are a big limitation for a lot of people . Drew draws a distinction between artistic and functional music . Artistic music is valued for the collaboration and creativity that goes into making it . Functional music is “music that exists in a world where it serves a purpose — but no-one gets in an elevator and asks about the music, what it’s doing and why it's there . There is a risk that great music will simply become lost in huge amounts of online content . Pascal Pilon compares music with video content: “If you think about the quality of lenses today and what people are using from their phones, there’s a ton of pictures being taken and there's a lot of videos being made.” Pilon also points out that AI tools can help navigate the flood of music . Future is likely to see an explosion of new music created by people who previously did not have the means to do so, enabled by AI-based tools . Equally, musicians and producers are likely to find more time to be creative and create music in new ways, leaving AI to manage repetitive functional tasks . There is much excitement, but a certain hesitation to ask incumbent labels to embrace pure generative AI . For sync, labels make a lot of money from using music in ads and for brands, so AI technology that adapts existing recordings more easily is also popular . The law on music copyright has been built upon highly unreliable technology called musicians and the human brain . With a machine, you don't have to rely on its memory, you just literally can see all of the notes there, so actually it’s easier than more difficult .",http://sosm.ag/AIMusic,0,Scrapes v3,

SGS Curriculum Resources Project | Princeton Science & Global Security,"The readings below are an initial selection of scholarly and other works for academics, professionals and activists seeking to engage with alternative frameworks of ideas, institutions, and policy action on nuclear issues . The readings are currently organized in six broad areas: Nuclear Disarmament, Nuclear Strategy and Deterrence, Science, Technology, and Security . Acheson discusses the road to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, including the intersecting roles of activists, diplomats and civil society . The article frames decolonization as an important force for progressive change in international system . Intondi tells the story of those black activists who fought for nuclear disarmament by connecting the nuclear issue with the fight for racial equality . The authors provide a feminist perspective on the proliferation and possession of WMD, particularly nuclear weapons . A seminal essay that shaped the ideas and politics of the European nuclear disarmament movement in the 1980s . The need therefore for disarmament efforts to focus on reshaping the entire economic, scientific, political and ideological support-system to nuclear weapon system . This article critiques the UK’s nuclear deterrence policy and practice . It looks at the connections between gender and discourses of the nuclear-armed state . The result is a critique of U.S. deterrence that makes more obvious its inherent racist, colonial and power-based claims . This special issue looks at nuclear weapons from the perspective of survivors, journalists, writers, lawyers, humanitarian practitioners and other experts . The Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapon Programs looks at the human cost and the emergence and early impacts of the humanitarian turn in global nuclear politics . This article argues that mainstream, state-sanctioned images of nuclear weapon testing in the Pacific invisibilise the militarisation and nuclear devastation imposed on the region . It engages with the work of two artists to amplify local perspectives on the impacts of nuclear weapons and examine the power inherent to imagery . In 1957–58, nine atmospheric nuclear tests were held at Malden Island and Christmas Island—today, part of the Pacific nation of Kiribati . In a micro-history about nuclear age as seen through two nuclear towns: Ozerk, Russia, and Hanford, Washington . The readings discuss the relationship between nuclear weapons and state power in the international system . Collectively, they challenge the idea that nuclear weapons are primarily a tool for state security . This essay challenges the Eurocentric nature of security studies in the nuclear age and the legitimacy of the possession and use of force . It argues that efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons deflect attention from a hierarchical global nuclear order dominated by powerful states and capitalist interests . The selections below do not address nuclear weapon issues specifically but offer ideas that may be useful for exploring nuclear weapons, their politics, and contexts . They include a theory of nuclear fetishism that shows nuclear weapons represent a new social form consistent with, yet distinct from, other fetish objects . Wajcman engages feminist scholarship and science and technology studies to highlight the continuities as well as the differences between contemporary and earlier feminist debates on technology . Proposes that science can “encode a structure of domination and violence”",https://sgs.princeton.edu/the-lab/sgs-curriculum-resources-project,0,Scrapes v3,

Ted Nelson explores what computers could’ve become,"Ted Nelson is the founding designer of Xanadu, the world's first hypertext project . Ted coined the word ""hypertext"" to describe non-sequential writing . His ideas have influenced projects ranging from Objective-C to the original WWW . Bob Greene: Vannevar Bush's Memex was a key moment for Greene . Greene: Bush's article influenced him strongly, and simultaneously influenced Douglas Engelbart . Greene says he had literary interests, theatrical interests before he went to college and had no idea what he wanted to major in . He says he was on student council and campaigned for sexual freedom . Ted Nelson: ""Most people don't get it because it's badly synchronized, it's in black and white, and it's a melancholy satire that's slow-moving"" Nelson: In graduate school, I took a computer course, and ""holy smoke, they lied"" Bob Greene: I wanted to start the personal computer industry, but Steve Jobs did it his way . Greene: To me, hypertext was going to be the document system of the future for all mankind as I hoped . Greene says the Xanadu Project became an ongoing project for years and years . He says the idea of hypertext with visible connections between pages was the key to creating a document system . Douglas Engelbart pioneered word processing, outline processing, multiple windows on a screen . He says Engelbart single-handedly and single-mindedly carried out his vision at Stanford Research Institute . Engelbart's Great Demo was in December in 1968, so the 50th anniversary is coming up this year . In '66, when I was working for Harcourt Brace, I visited Doug Engelbart's laboratory . He kind of half offered me a programming job, but I wanted to do it my way . Doug lost his office, and eventually sold the project to McDonnell Douglas, an aircraft company that didn't know what to do with it . Xanadu founder says he came up with the word hypertext in '63 . He says his idea is parallel pages with visible connections to connect ideas, other forms of writing . ""I'm just pounding on trying to make people understand it, and trying very hard still to get it implemented,"" he says . In Xanadu document, you deliver a list of portions to bring in and how to put them together . Creative Commons is just a way that people can give up the hope of being paid in a polite and elegant form . Xanadu is a combination of a document management system and an operating system . It manages a federation of similar discs containing source content and links . In the presentation that's on the archive, we see visible connections between the first and last draft of the Declaration of Independence as written by Thomas Jefferson . Xanadu: ""If we had had these bilateral transclusions and links that would let people go back and forth and see the common source,"" how would the web today be different? ""The best thing that Tim did was to create the URL, because before he started, every drive from every operating system had a different way of addressing . Xanadu aims to be a literary system that people can use for making parallel pages with visible connections . The average lifetime of a web page is 100 days before it changes or disappears, says Ted Sutter . Sutter: ""I'm not looking for them. I'm trying to get a minimal viable product"" Xanadu creator says he has no idea what the future of micropayments will be . He says he supported copyright because it was necessary and part of the publishing world . Xanadus creator: ""I have so many things I would have done differently. Oh my, yes"" Bill Gates was a visionary in the 1970s when he first met Bill Gates . He knew personal computing was coming, and he built BASIC at Harvard . He and his pal copied Digital Equipment version of BASIC on stolen time at Harvard for six months . Digital Equipment Corporation was the pioneers in computer graphics and in small machines . The company that made the first little computers, Digital Equipment Corp. went under . After that it was one job after another — one fringe job after one, he says . He says he's been ""dancing through this world, and seeing how other people thought"" The other — by which I hope to cure myself — is to persuade everybody else .

The Sultan’s concern was less to do with drawing a line through the landscape in order to define relationships between people and land, and more about the fluid, ever-changing network of such relationships . The question of the exact line of the boundary was raised again in 1947, this time in light of oil exploration . Petroleum Concessions Limited, a subsidiary of the multinational Iraq Petroleum Company, were keen to explore southern Arabia in search of oil . The land is seen for its economic potential, and a specific way of representing the land is required to facilitate the extraction of that potential . The India Office Record reveals one particular way of viewing the world, one guided and reinforced by maps and the process of map-making . This view demands a certain kind of precision and a representation of the world that works to impose a set of relations on the land it represents .",https://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2021/04/the-view-from-a-hill-making-sense-of-ras-dharbat-ali-in-the-archive.html,0,Scrapes v3,

Anthropocene Working Group voted to approve the mid-20th century as the origin point of the Anthropocene period . But a backlash emerged from this dating, with scholars arguing that it is far too early to set a date in stone . Geologists and climate scientists have recently called for a broader debate, in order to define a more historically sensitive vision . Renaissance understanding of latitude, sunlight, and time was the original definition of “climate” in 1610 . This system defined life across the globe in terms of the latitude bands dividing the globe into navigable global space . The Anthropocene era and global movement of life that triggered a global drop in carbon dioxide identified by scientists at the time was not a byproduct of colonialism .

Neotopology | Digital Humanities at Stanford,"The Texas Digital Humanities Consortium's First Annual Conference about networks and specifically networks in the humanities . This is part of a talk I gave at #txdhc. It leaves out ""principles of interloping in network science"" Neotopology refers to the use of cartographic and spatial analytic tools and techniques by designers, humanists, software developers and others outside of the traditional domains of GIS, GIScience and cartography . Neogeography has produced incredible work, including the amazing Voronoi experiments that Jason Davies has been creating, satellite projected views of the US/Mexico border by Mike Bostock . In the same way that journalists, designers and software developers and humanities scholars have flooded into spatial analysis and visualization, the same groups are flooding into network analysis . In 2002, scholars like Willard McCarty in ""Humanities Computing: Essential Problems, Experimental Practice"" were not even referring to digital humanities, but rather ""humanities computing"" and ""computer assisted humanities"" Network analysis in digital humanities scholarship is so early on that it hasn't even managed to put together and publish a single edited volume . The spatial turn was not about historians learning GIS, it was about everyone getting access to geospatial data, tools and techniques . A network is a view of a system that preferences the importance of connections between objects in that system and the emergent properties of those connections when examined in the aggregate . This is, I think, where we shine as humanists and interlopers. Our work with networks is not our sole methodology or concern . Insofar as ""the network turn"" I'm not referring to the application of network analysis by any research agenda . Rather, I refer to the widespread adoption of . network analysis and visualization by humanities scholars to address traditional humanities research questions .

DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly: The Literary And/As the Digital Humanities,"English departments have been fundamental to the development of much of the content that constitutes the emerging canon of digital humanities research . Digital data and databases have become indisputable resources for literary study, not just for archival research but also literary interpretation . This special issue seeks to show how the digital humanities can and should be understood as supporting literary interpretation . The digital humanities is not just a means of acquiring and accessing data about literary genres, literary history, and the reading and writing practices enabled by them . Recent innovations in the field of literary studies provide avenues towards answering this question in meaningful ways . The relationship between the literary and the digital humanities has been inescapable as a subject at recent conferences of the Modern Language Association . The tension between traditional literary practices of interpretation and those of the DH motivates discussion about the present and future shape of the humanities . Kathleen Fitzpatrick is now the MLA’s Director of Scholarly Communication, a position that is decidedly focused on digital forms of communication and/as scholarly “products” and practices . In the midst of a financial crisis that resulted in a dearth of new positions in higher education, the 2012 MLA job market list included well over thirty positions for professors with a research specialty in the Digital Humanities . The special issue is an attempt to stake a claim for the importance of the humanities in our digital culture . The essays explore points of intersection between the literary and the digital humanities from diverse perspectives . Some update close reading; others probe the boundaries of what counts as literary data . The technologies and perspectives employed by digital commerce invite literary criticism to explore the “middle ground” where critical judgments about the literary are made . This same middle ground — the meeting places where readers find, read, and respond to texts — is another subject of interest for the writers in this issue . The essay models a method of experimenting with the forms used to encode discourse about the literary . The potential for the literary to participate in political and social change via digital technologies inspires other essays in this issue . The essays explore the effects of the digital humanities on the literary and, conversely, the influence of literary studies on digital humanities . Collectively, they show how the humanities are, indeed, already digital . The essays are all exemplary attempts to consider how literary studies matters to digital culture . Anne Burdick, Johanna Drucker, Peter Lunenfeld, Todd Presner, and Jeffrey Schnapp have explored these issues .

Teaching and the Digital Humanities | American Academy of Arts and Sciences,"On April 2, 2015, at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, a panel discussion on pedagogy in undergraduate digital humanities classrooms . William G. Thomas III (Angle Chair in the Humanities and Professor of History, University of Nebraska – Lincoln), Anne Cong-Huyen (Digital Scholar, Whittier College), Angel David Nieves (Associate Professor of Africana Studies, Hamilton College), and Jessica Marie Johnson (Assistant Professor of Historian, Michigan State University) participated . Richard Murray: Students need to be working in the open web rather than contained content- or learning-management systems, such as Blackboard . Murray: Murray’s first book on narrative in cyberspace provided much of the foundation for his initial engagement with teaching students to be producers in the digital medium . He says Murray's ""affordance grid"" is essential guide to enable students to think critically about the nature of the digital media . Students in the History Harvest become producers in the digital medium, rather than consumers of digital content . Students see their work as public, community-oriented, and part of a larger ongoing endeavor . Schools around the United States are developing courses modeled after History Harvest . The Digital Liberal Arts Center is not a digital humanities center, but a teaching resource center . Its goals are to increase student engagement, to produce more public-facing work, and to show responsibility to the community in the Quaker tradition . As a small school with very limited resources, we have become a teaching center . Former students at UCLA created a digital book in the Scalar publishing platform . Students were asked to go into different ethnic enclaves in Los Angeles and produce urban ethnographies of those communities . The core values of “a predominantly textual orientation and a focus on technology as tool embedded in the digital humanities,” have in many ways relegated digital humanities to two centers at most research institutions: the English and history departments . The margins – area studies, identity studies, interdisciplinary studies – have become more central to standard practice with the advent of digital humanities . The promise of a “new renaissance scholar” with mastery in many disciplines may become increasingly commonplace, says Dr. Roland Martin . Martin: Digital humanities, digital tools, and working in digital, radical, or new media is significantly reshaping how faculty engage with students . He says the prospect of twenty-first century interdisciplinarity is made real . There is a fundamental difference in how students approach research via the written page and how they present their research via screen and code . American studies, ethnic studies, Africana studies, and women’s studies programs can have a special role to play for digital humanities projects . The interface itself – a website, a database, the computer itself – raises questions for all ranges of history . Some students do not want to engage with academic issues on Facebook or Twitter or Tumblr; for some students, those sites represent their leisure time . But other students – many of whom are themselves training to become teachers – are particularly interested in how digital tools work . Social media sites frequently serve as gateways to more specifically purpose-driven digital tools . We are used to nonlinearity in our lives, in our books and film, and in our social media, but we have not introduced this to our teaching . How do we capture the attention of contemporary students as they sit in the classroom tweeting? Academic: We have to build a framework that will allow us to take advantage of social and historical currency . Digital approaches that could complement traditional exhibitions can be designed to reach groups who might not consider coming in person . The humanities present a clearer picture for the average person of how digital technology serves the purpose of research . In using digital technologies, the future will belong to those who see the value in collaboration, says director of Smithsonian . National resources found at places like the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress, and the National Archives can be of great value for the types of projects discussed in this forum . William G. Thomas III: Is there a risk that the pace of information flow could outstrip our ability to convey and appreciate the art of the humanities? He says in the field of history, we do not have many examples of compositional, interpretive scholarship in the digital space . The American Historical Association has put together a committee to look at what digital scholarship is . Anne Cong-Huyen: It is a very risky operation for young faculty to step forward and create something that they are calling interpretive and “compositional” – as you have put it – digital scholarship . The humanities are of great importance to our ability to address and read data critically, she says . There is a diffuseness sometimes around topics when you do digital learning that you do not see when you have only a captive audience and lecture notes . Platforms like Blackboard and other closed learning management systems do not interface very well with outside platforms, says Jessica Marie Johnson . In the conversation we are having about students as producers and consumers, I think that with social media as pedagogy, students are both consuming and producing . We may charge students with finding ways to produce, but they are also consuming all the time . Digital pedagogy is not taken as seriously as some of the other kinds of digital humanities work that is going on . Perhaps this work is ignored because it has actually been going on for a long time . Perhaps in the presence of never-ending change we need patience to let our innovative use of maturing technologies determine the state of the art .",https://bit.ly/2O7l1vV,0,Scrapes v3,
How Not to Teach Digital Humanities · Ryan Cordell,"The following is a talk I’ve revised over the past few years . It began with a post on “curricular incursion”, the ideas of which developed through a talk at DH2013 . There is a more polished version of the article available in Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016 . In the first part of this talk, I want to outline three challenges I see hampering truly innovative digital pedagogy in humanities classrooms . “What is DH? ” has become a prolific genre in its own right; there are no shortage of such claims about what the field is or should be . ‘Digital’ humanities is often defined in these pieces by contrast to “traditional” humanities . This is because DH practitioners understand how entrenched fields such as history and literature can be, how suspicious of computationally-informed methods and tools . Using the term “digital humanities” is often a tactical error, especially when trying to introduce digital humanities into the undergraduate curriculum . But our concern with defining and propagating the field writ large can interfere with innovative but necessarily local thinking about digital skills . Frida Ghitis: Stop calling it ""digital humanities"" or ""DH"" with a knowing air . Ghitis says the backlash against the field has already arrived . She says the word humanities is opaque, vaguely signaling fields that are not the sciences, but even that broad definition is hazy. Ghitis writes: For many undergraduate students, “liberal arts” signifies no more than “humanities” The phrase “digital humanities” often raises perfectly valid worries with our students, many of whom have spent their entire educational careers sleepwalking through ed tech nightmares . Of course, MOOCs are hardly synonymous with digital humanities, and indeed, DH practitioners have been among the most critical of the MOOC movement . Few students surveyed believe their instructors use technology effectively, and a majority believe they understand technology better than their teachers . The skills students want are those which would allow them to create their own digital work, and perhaps even their own tools . The digital humanities faces challenges in defining itself as a field, says John Sutter . Sutter: My “Technologies of Text” class is in essence a book history class with a strong DH undercurrent . Students leave with fewer but more well-developed skills from which they can build . “Technologies of Text” teaches many DH ideas and skills: edit wikipedia, encode documents in TEI, learn the basics of computational text analysis, or program chatbots using Python . These labs are framed not within a narrative of recent scholarly revolution, but within a sweeping discussion of book and media history . These labs prepare students to develop their own “unessays” as midterm and final assignments . They include theoretical engagements with media, video essays, argumentative listicles, altered books, built morse code devices, and even physical “twitter poetry bot” generators . These assignments allowed students to grapple with those aspects of the course they found most compelling . When introducing digital humanities into our classrooms, we must structure those introductions for students with a wide range of technical backgrounds and aptitudes . Digital humanities pedagogy must inculcate: not “how to use x tool,” but more “understanding how x functions, delineating its affordances and limitations, and then imagining y or z ” Courses at the 300 and 400 level should build on those introductory courses, says John Sutter . Sutter: Thinking locally can help you connect DH classes and projects to collections, colleagues, and your institution’s mission . In Digital_Humanities, authors argue that humanities disciplines need to each establish agendas for computational practices . Authors: Maintaining criticality and experimentation means challenging received tradi- tions . Digital humanities is a useful banner for gathering a community of scholars doing weird humanities work with computers . I suspect it will continue to be useful for awhile yet, long after the current wave of DH mania subsides . I hope it will eventually become a more productive rapprochement with the larger humanities fields .",https://ryancordell.org/teaching/how-not-to-teach-digital-humanities/,0,Scrapes v3,

Digital Humanities and Sound Studies – The Duke Reader,"A review of Digital Sound Studies, edited by Mary Caton Lingold, Darren Mueller, and Whitney Trettien, Duke University Press, 2018 . Young PhDs majoring in the social sciences and the humanities often list an interest in sound studies when they enter the academic job market . Digital humanities and sonic materials have so far had a limited impact on social science scholarship . Despite its societal impact and economic value, technology is not the primary engine of change in the academy . Monetary incentives, reinforced by institutional recognition, are what makes the academic world go round . By contrast, barriers to entry into the field of digital humanities are very low . Digital sound studies intersect with issues of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and postcoloniality . Categories borrowed from prosody and rhetorics are finding new uses in technologies exploring speech patterns and sound archives in order to “search sound with sound. ” There is also a premium for political correctness. The book is a blueprint for making sound central to research, teaching, and publishing practices . The frontier between art and science blurs and the public is invited to take part in a performance of “artistic research” Digital Sound Studies taught me more about the functioning of academia in a segment of disciplinary studies than about sound studies and digital humanities as such .

Launching a library digital humanities center: reflections and lessons learned,"In January 2018, San Diego State University Library officially opened its Digital Humanities Center . Since opening, the DHC has become an interdisciplinary hub that brings people together in support of humanistic research, teaching and learning in the digital age . The DHC has established itself as the home of DH@SDSU. Early successes include wide-ranging engagement across the disciplines, broad faculty buy-in, increasing pedagogic partnerships, and creative experimentation . The continued success depends on the success of the various partnerships that went into creating the center, partnerships that will have to be rebuilt . DH@SDSU would continue to grow without the DHC . Threats to long-term capacity and sustainability can be mitigated by creating partnerships that grow distributed expertise . The space, as much as the services, needs to be user-centered and designed to meet its institutional context while being responsive and adaptable to changing user needs .",https://bit.ly/3skUryh,0,Scrapes v3,

Distant Reading after Moretti – Lauren F. Klein,"Franco Moretti, the man who coined the phrase “distant reading,’s most famous exemplar, is among the men named as a result of the #MeToo movement . Marisa Parham, Alan Liu, and Ted Underwood were the other speakers . Howard Ramsby was also scheduled to present, but he was unable to attend because of the blizzard . The #MeToo movement erases the voices of the Black women who did the earliest and most difficult work of the field . The problem is not a coincidence that distant reading does not deal well with gender, or with sexuality, or race . Without those voices, conceptual structures, as well as institutional ones, remain securely in place . We need to assemble more corpora—more accessible corpora that perform the work of recovery or resistance . We also need to rethink how we formulate our models . The view from a distance, is, of course, as much of a view of a particular place as a view from up close .

The Cine-Files » videographic scholarship and/as digital humanities,"For cinema and media studies scholars, the emergence of two areas of scholarly practice—namely videographic scholarship and the Digital Humanities (DH) — has created opportunities for new forms of argumentation, analysis and research . The center of gravity in today’s understanding of DH lies with large-scale, computational analysis of machine-readable data . Video essays represent an evolved scholarly vernacular that uniquely serves critical goals in terms of research and publication . We are now past the point where videographic scholarship needs to demonstrate its contributions to the field or justify claims to academic legitimacy . The role of the visual extends only as far as the type of high-density, Cultural Analytics visualizations associated with Software Studies . Heftberger locates the intersection of DH and film studies closer to statistical analysis than even the most algorithmically-driven video essays . The processes of discovery and experimentation are often the more exciting and insightful parts of scholarly endeavors . For videographic scholars, the “distant reading” of tropes that emerge across large categories of media, such as a film genre or a multi-season run of a television series, may be understood as a form of data visualization . Video essays more apt to preserve the pleasures of viewing, even when the ultimate goal is a critically distant reading . For de Fren, Kogonada represents a figure who operates successfully across the once unbridgeable divide separating YouTube from academia in his development of virtuosic elaborations on the supercut . The more care one devotes to crafting a cinematic experience that is viscerally, aesthetically, affectively appealing, the less comprehensive and encyclopedic one’s research can reasonably be . The fundamental difference between algorithmically deformed or process-oriented works of videographic scholarship and Digital Humanities methods lies in the extent to which analytical tools and media sources are open and available to a scholarly community as part of the finished work . By contrast, a digital Humanities research platform might aggregate and redistribute a data set within an analytical framework that is interactive . The downfall of both Labyrinth, which moved from (now obsolete) hard media formats (CD ROM and DVD ROM) to the web, was technological obsolescence and lack of interoperability . A video essay is a closed ecosystem that resists quotation, citation or revision, and does not allow direct access to source materials . The public media archive Critical Commons was created to address this need . The real value of the peer review process and each video’s accompanying paratexts is additive and contextual rather than strictly editorial . The Vectors journal's two-stage review process may be what is needed to maximize the benefits offered by peer review to videographic scholarship that is more process-oriented . Steve Anderson: The value of videographic scholarship lies in the bidirectional process of disassembling certain critical conventions . Anderson: A two-stage (rough cut/fine cut) review schedule is consistent with standard post-production workflows in the creative industries . A shift in emphasis from completed work to research-in-progress may be exactly the transition the field needs . The NEH’s Office of Digital Humanities has actively supported videographic criticism, including the three years of summer workshops held at Middlebury College from 2015-2018 .

Dr. Gabriela Baeza Ventura and Dr. Carolina A. Villarroel discuss their experience working on recovery projects with Arte Público Press, and how their early efforts to digitize Spanish-language newspapers prepared them to take a leading role in establishing a center for Latinx digital humanities . Gabriella Base Aventura is an associate professor of Hispanic literature in Hispanic studies at the University of Houston where she teaches courses on U. S. Latino literature for graduate and undergraduate students . Carolina Villarroel is the former archivist in charge of the mexican american and african american collection at the Houston Metropolitan Research Center . She is the Brown Foundation director of research of recovering The. US. Hispanic literary heritage . Maria, a leader in the digital in the field of Digital Humanities and giving us a lot of important theory to discuss right into center, some of the work that we’ve been doing for a long time . She says the urgency for establishing a center in digital humanities that would extend the work of the recovery program to document and disseminate literature . Arte Publico started in 1979 with the revista chicano re kenya . The goal for for for the for the creation of of that magazine and the publishing house was to serve as a venue for the work of academics, artists, writers, you know, and writers of all genres poetry, fiction, nonfiction . Mercado: Arte Publico Press developed its imprint pinata books, which these which went into publishing books for for the for Children, right, Children and young adults, which now is like a whole new monster of its own right now . The recovery project was really about recovering work from a specific period right from the colonial era to was a cut off 0. 1960s . And we are able to recover part of the chicano movement and and you know, and include everything that you've been recovering . Researchers were able to read the newspaper so to upload these huge images into something to make it available, it was impossible . So we we started conversations with f school first and they offer us to create a platform to showcase our databases, especially newspapers as you mentioned . Melon grant was the first archival platform they were creating . It was the prototype for a school for the following archival, you know, work that they’re doing right now and especially in spanish. And, and uh, we were able to release a database of 400 newspapers with news bank. That was a game changer for, for our scholars because they're all over the world. And with this database are able to access the newspapers from their homes to do their research that before was impossible. Arte Publico is a non-profit that primarily works with foundations to get grants to publish most of its books . The project officer or the project officer at that moment told us that we were very ambitious, and I was at first I was like, you know, at my colonial ... colonial attitude . The Latinas received a grant from the Mellon Foundation to help them create a digital humanity center . The goal for for this grant was for us to create a Digital humanity center. And so we toured a bunch of different digital humanity centers across the nation, made amazing people . The idea is that we train more people so that more people are going out there to train people like us, right? So that we uncover all of these materials that are hidden in some of these archives or in communities where people where people still don’t feel comfortable, uh, sending their materials to university or an academic or traditional archives . A lot of these, a lot of the workshops and the presentation’s free, you know, and accessible to all the communities . And also in in languages other than english as well. That was huge for us, but for them of their careers and how they think about their careers as futurist colors . There’s a two create digital scholarship was one of them uh create access to the recovery archives, you know, uh and first, but then to bring visibility to the different archives that are out there that related to the latino and Latina community, um and consolidate this this this community center . There’s a lot of Latinas who are doing a . lot of, you know, a lot . of this work that a lot times don’t get invited to do presentations, keynotes and that's what we want to do . The list that we have created that are on our website, um, are visited options so that people see and, and also that people act themselves to these lists . Latin X is an expansive and complex world, with people involved in infrastructure and tool development and people interested in archives and making them available . Digital humanities approach could be linked to D. H. In very interesting ways . Latinas are embattled a lot of times with colonial practices, right? And where we need to ask ourselves, are we are we gonna reproduce some of these systems that continue to oppress and and and create, you know, a system of second class citizen citizenry for for our projects and for our communities . We we we our goal is to always choose free software that is free so that if we have opportunities or cases where community wants to reproduce the same .

A Harvard degree boosts the odds of winning for all writers, but a Black writer who attended Harvard is 19 times more likely to win . A Black writer with an elite degree is about 13 percent more likely than a writer without a elite degree .

New project has brought together his writings in a searchable database . The Eric Hobsbawm Bibliography is an open-access database that allows anyone to search the bibliography according to a range of criteria . It was originally conceived as an attempt to bring order to an increasingly chaotic bibliographical landscape . The Eric Hobsbawm Bibliography became the most comprehensive and complex record of writings currently available . The database contains more than three thousand entries . It was conceived as an exercise in professional service . Hobsbawm was obsessed with the written word . He continued to write even through some of his most difficult personal circumstances . He kept a diary for several years as an orphaned teenager in London . The range of concepts for which he became known indicate a restless mind . Hobsbawm could cash in on his fame without coming up with new ideas, writes Andrew Keen . Keen: The written word was his passport to global fame . Keen says he trialed ideas and arguments in non-English publications before introducing them to English-language audience . Keen's work was especially true of his writings and interventions in Italy . There are vanishingly few women listed in the bibliography of Eric Hobsbawm . The bibliography speaks to the shape of both the historical profession and left-wing intellectual life in postwar Europe . The paucity of translations into Eastern European or Asian languages indicate that his ideas did not reach a wide audience . Focusing on the physical infrastructure of Hobsbawm’s writings is a reminder to scholars of intellectual life that the form in which ideas are packaged is almost as important as the content .

“Chapter 23: Digital Humanities As/Is a Tactical Term | Matthew Kirschenbaum” in “Debates in the Digital Humanities” on Debates in the DH Manifold,"Digital Humanities As/Is a Tactical Term . At a moment when the academy in general and the humanities in particular are the objects of massive and wrenching changes, digital humanities emerges as a rare vector for jujitsu . ""Digital humanities"" is not a transitory term that will soon fall away in favor of just the humanities once again, or perhaps humanities 2. 0 . But it has use value to the degree one underscores its semantic edges, says Julian Zelizer . Zelizer: The other distinctive component at our current moment is the role of social media, and Twitter most particularly of all . Digital humanities is a term possessed of enough currency and escape velocity to penetrate layers of administrative strata to get funds allocated and initiatives under way . On the other hand, it is a populist term, self-identified and self-perpetuating through the algorithmic structures of contemporary social media . In what follows I will explore an example of each and then offer some concluding comments about the implications of this strange confluence . By 2001, Unsworth had in hand a draft proposal for a master’s degree in digital humanities to be housed within the newly established program in media studies at Virginia . The proposal eventually died somewhere in the University of Virginia's administrative ether . The institutional landscape is defined as one of media studies versus humanities computing . The term ""digital media"" is the name of a humanities computing (or digital media) research agenda . It is presented as the constitutive element of the humanities computing research agenda in Virginia . The key substitution of “humanities” for “media” seems straightforward enough . Digital humanities emerges as the wider ranging locution, with humanities computing solidified as its “interdisciplinary core” A third key component was the founding of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations shortly thereafter, where Unsworth played a central role . Digital humanities is a mobile and tactical signifier, whether from the standpoint of universities, publishers, scholarly organizations, funders, the press, or its actual practitioners . But in a Web 2.0 world of tweets, streams, and feeds, it is also more than a signifier . Digital humanities (and its universal truncation DH), in other words, are identifiers routinely operationalized through various network services . Digital Humanities Now combines the conceit of a scholarly journal with the real-time automated aggregation enabled by Twitter’s open Application Programming Interface . In practice, the site works only middling well, with many overtly non-DH topics getting promoted to the status of a “refereed” entry on the dhnow feed . Digital humanities emerges as “tactical” in the sense that it is also procedural in such an instance, operationalized through the automated functions of a site that harvests a self-selecting group of users . For example, Twitter’s “Who to Follow” feature functions as a sort of phonebook for the service, allowing users to search for user accounts based on topic relevance . Twitter’s “Who to Follow” feature is a product of an inexorable calculus of influence and reputation that continually sorts, ranks, and situates, plucking patterns and trends from the data stream . The end result is obvious: the mappings are self-perpetuating, so that those who are currently identified as influential users in a given topic space will accumulate even more followers as a result of their visibility . Shumway argues that the star system in literary studies is a distinct historical phenomenon that originates in the late 1970s . He sees it as serving to undermine the public’s confidence in the academy by diluting the authority of the rank-and-file professoriate . Online relationships are eminently portable across the analog/digital membrane . Those who are in positions of visibility and impact online reap rewards that have more tangible consequences in meatspace . Networks, as Dianne Rocheleau and Robin Roth remind us, are “relational webs shot through with power” Much energy is now being expended on defining what digital humanities is, on whether a paper or proposal was accepted or rejected because it was or was not “real” digital humanities, and so forth . Digital humanities has also been claimed, some might even say radicalized, as precisely that space where traditional academic and institutional practices are vulnerable to intervention . The adoption of the ‘digital media’ rubric was, as you note correctly, a tactical one within UVA’s environment, meant to aim at a compromise in which critical/theoretical issues from media studies might feel legitimate as part of the practice .

The Disappearance of Books Threatens to Erode Fine Arts Libraries,"Public libraries are experiencing a renaissance in use that few could have predicted even a decade ago . But libraries are no longer solely filled with books . Many are shifting to become multi-use and more digitally driven spaces . At the University of Texas at Austin, around 75,000 fine arts books, journals, and other materials have already been moved . Curators of the Blanton Museum of Art have expressed their displeasure with the current and future plans for the Fine Arts Library . In 2017, an entire floor of books was swept away almost overnight, without consultation of faculty or students, to make way for a new high-tech design program . The University of Wisconsin Library System has recently released a Facilities Master Plan, which proposes to eliminate the Kohler Art Library by 2030 . Many university libraries are engaged in a book purge . This has meant reassessing the use of library spaces and consolidating book holdings in a bid to attract more visitors . At Syracuse University, there was a faculty uproar over the proposed movement of books to a far-away warehouse . This week, a rare fossil is discovered, a new book on artist Niki de Saint Phalle is published, the erasure of women philosophers continues, a culinary map of China, and much more .

Topic Modeling Headline News About the Anti-Vietnam War Movement in the 1960s: Results and Resources – Adam Tomasi,"In 1965, President Johnson escalated U.S. military presence in Vietnam and called up 50,000 draftees . This escalation galvanized the anti-Vietnam War movement . Both young and old had deep political or philosophical commitments that guided their activism even if their personal lives were not directly affected by the war . These are the twenty topics that MALLET generated from my corpus . The numbers in parentheses are the topic number, referring not to ‘most important’ or “least important” like a ranking . The decimal values represent the frequency of each topic’s occurrence in the entire corpus . Some words are very obvious (such as “pickets” connects to ‘picketing’), but for others I had to do close reading . Deciding each topic label was an iterative process of looking back at the texts . Line graphs show the frequency of each topic in the US news between 1964 and 1965 . They focus on headline news between March 1964 and December 1965 . For Students and the Draft, the frequencies increase significantly starting in March 1965 after President Johnson’s announcement the previous February that the military would be conscripting 50,000 people for Vietnam . If I expand the visualization to 1966, there may be other vigils leading up to that moment which made the tactic popular for non-religious organizations in addition to clergy against the Vietnam War .",http://adamjamestomasi.com/dh-projects/topic-modeling-anti-vietnam-war-movement/,0,Scrapes v3,
Word Embeddings and Their Role in Synonym Ring Construction – The Digital Humanities Commons,"In a previous blogpost, I described what synonym rings are, but simply put, you can think of them as groups of similar words and phrases that should be treated as equivalent for the purpose of information retrieval . If a user enters a search term that can be found in one of the rings, the rest of the words in the ring will also be added to the query and, thus, the query will be expanded . The discovery system used by the KU Leuven Libraries already expands certain query terms with their variant forms using thesauri (such as the Library of Congress Using the cosine similarity measure, I was able to see which words (and phrases) are most similar to my target word (or phrase) according to my model . Not all results for all concepts for which I wanted to create synonym rings were as successful as those for “digital humanities ” Even so, I still consider this method to be promising . The current results definitely require a human editor to weed them out . Jurafsky, D. , & Martin, J. H. (2020).

An overview of recent digital humanities initiatives in US art libraries | Art Libraries Journal | Cambridge Core,"Art librarians frequently interact with the digital humanities in a broad sense . New art information professionals are expected to be conversant with digital humanities . The Humanities Commons is a platform for open information sharing in the Humanities . The ARLIS/NA Commons will soon feature the Digital Art History Directory (DAHD) A well-designed, user-friendly interface, along with a taxonomy for project types, and subject and keyword searching make the directory an indispensable resource for discovering digital art history . The DH SIG plans to adopt communication channels available in the Commons including a calendar, social networking features and collaborative document and file sharing . Linked data will be created on topics including artists, specifically, from Black, Latinx and Native American communities; artists’ files; art historians/historiography; works of art, including portraits, manga, and campus public art and architecture . The rich data available in Wikidata populates network visualizations and informs a variety of other DH projects . Recent edit-a-thons for the Art + Feminism Wikipedia group have included the National Museum Women in the Arts Library focusing on women artists of color . Digital skill building meets visual literacy in Building Visual Literacy: A Toolkit for Interdisciplinary Teaching from University Art Collections . The Yale Arts Library brought a traditional art history visual resources collection into more than a thousand dimensions with PixPlot . The Getty Research Center's 12 Sunsets visualizes more than 60,000 of Ed Ruscha's Sunset Strip photographs . The Animal Crossing Art Generator takes artworks out of the museum and into a popular game by Nintendo called Animal Crossing . Despite established workflows and technological advances that have made digitization efforts and digital exhibitions routine, many barriers remain, and many collections are not yet digitized . Digital preservation remains perpetually on the horizon . Digital humanities have enabled art libraries to extend the reach of many traditional functions such as collection building and development, bibliographic instruction, providing access to unique materials and original cataloguing in support of art and architecture fields .

The Banff Centre is now reconsidering the value of the BNMI as it builds its digital renewal . The polysemy (that is, multiple meanings) of digital works presents challenges . The works preserved themselves may have different meanings for originators or creators, and for people involved in preservation . Digital archives that include historic materials may raise specific questions too . Digital humanists often turn towards self-funding to cover part or even all of their project costs . But when self funding becomes infeasible, as it often does with larger and more collaborative projects, digital humanists typically turn towards grant-writing . Sustaining or preserving each individual digital project requires additional labor and funding . This essay will explore the role of soft and hard funding in the digital humanities . The availability and sustainability of funding as project needs change over time, along with funders' agendas, can influence project teams' decisions . Seeking funding should become part of wider strategies that enable the formation of mutually beneficial relationships .

The “Should I include Digital Humanities in my grant proposal?” Guide for Humanities people – LaTeX Ninja'ing and the Digital Humanities,"Many Humanities scholars feel like you can’t get a project funded anymore if it doesn't include DH . Some even ask me “Do I have to include DH to get funded? ” Well, that answer lies outside of my expertise . But I can, however, answer the probably even more important question of whether you should include DH in your grant proposal for the main purpose of improving your chances at getting funded . A lot of Humanities people seem to think that “you can’t get a project funded nowadays if it’s not included DH” If you’re not good at DH, you should not include DH in your proposal . You should always ask yourself what kind of scholar is likely to serve as a reviewer for your project . Humanities scholars seem to have a skewed, unrealistic idea of what “doing DH” actually means . Don’t be fooled into thinking it will be easy just because that’s what people say funding agencies are looking for . There is no such thing as free lunch and “The DH have it easier” is a fallacy . There really is no way you can do meaningful DH-related work if you don’t know what ‘digital’ even entails . “Going digital”, if you’ve never as much as had a brush with the digital so far, can be harder than you might think . Plan at least a few months for this, so your brain has time to process . Do contact DH people early on when there’s still room for actual cooperation . Calculate that you will need some time to get everyone on the same page, then generate ideas and synergies . Don’t make the first contact with DH people 2-3 weeks before the submission deadline . Humanities scholars need to be willing to allocate serious project resources to DH work . Humanities scholar is not your free lunch, it costs at least one 20h position . How to include DH in your grant proposal the right way? Do your homework . Plan at least a few months for this, so your brain has time to process . Write it so that both sides can fully understand it . Contact actual DH people early on in the process and integrate them into your proposal . Acknowledge your current level of realistic DH skill . Be wary of borderline-DH people who seem in denial about the fact that they don’t have much of a grasp on the DH community as a whole . Checklist: Do you know what the term ‘Computer Literacy’ entails? Do you have it?

Our Reflection on our Digital Humanities Journey: Challenges and Rewards – Manuel's Blog,"We are grateful for all the knowledge we have accumulated thanks to this wonderful course . One of the biggest obstacles to overcome was group work online . The challenges made the course interesting but overcoming them made it meaningful and empowering . Palladio was not difficult to use, rather inconvenient and impractical to use . Timeline JS is an amazing tool that we enjoyed using . TimeLine JS allowed us to illustrate the different pit stops and life experiences of our author, especially since it illustrated how the author’s knowledge was accumulated . A group of undergraduates created their own website using WordPress, a content management system that allowed us to create websites for free . The students say it is an interactive platform, not like a Microsoft Word document or PDF that only the teacher gets to see . Another rewarding tool they had the chance to use was the spreadsheet on google drive . AUB students used Google Drive and Google Docs to learn about interactive data sources . Most data that was truly informative either came from the novels directly or from scholarly articles . Another limitation was the type of data we used . ENGL 256B has given us the opportunity to think outside the box and use our creativity to personalize our assignments . It gave us a certain degree of freedom and liberty to write what we wanted and what we deemed fit . Previous to this course, we believed technology and literature belonged to two separate worlds . This is the only course, to our knowledge, that tackles the subject from another perspective, using digital tools, and shows us how DH and other technologies impact literature . Even though we might have found some difficulties, we were able to overcome them .",https://manuelmikhayel.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/our-reflection-on-our-digital-humanities-journey-challenges-and-rewards/,0,Scrapes v3,
Complexities of Learning DH Tools and Methods of Analysis During the Pandemic – Lynn's Blog,"It is no secret that the Covid 19 pandemic changed our perspective on life, from our simplest habits to our most ambitious dreams . As university students, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, we were faced with the pressure to be the best we could be . With remote studying and online conferencing, the learning process was much more complicated . The DH project is focused on comparing and contrasting the two protagonists Sherlock Holmes and Inspector Poirot . We aimed at looking up different emotions, character traits, tonality of voice, and other elements that explain how the two main characters were portrayed . The main issue we faced when using Palladio was finding relevant data to insert onto the program . The way we tried to tackle this issue was numerazing the events and most recurrent themes in the short stories . The other problem we faced was related to the incorrect visual uploading of the cover pages of our selected short stories onto the tool . We looked up different potential solutions on the Internet and tried our best to figure out when reaching out to other students but none of that worked .

MSU Digital Humanities Initiative Receives Garfinkel Prize – College of Arts & Letters,"A digital humanities collective in the MSU College of Arts & Letters has won the 2020 Garfinkel Prize in Digital Humanities presented by the American Studies Association . The website provides a digital space where writers, artists, students, and scholars of color reflect on their intellectual and artistic works, strategies for imagining worlds otherwise, and their intimate freedom practices . The site was inspired by the practices of their ancestors who extricated themselves from slavery and colonial dispossession to form independent communities . The word “taller” (pronounced ta-yer) is the Spanish word for workshop or artist studio, often seen as a space of collectivity, collaboration, and action . The site also serves as an organizing mechanism for exhibits, events, and workshops . A four-week Bomba workshop was held in conjunction with Bombazo Dance Company . MSU students and community members from across the globe were able to learn the history, rhythms, and moves of Afro-Puerto Rican Bomba .",https://cal.msu.edu/news/msu-digital-humanities-initiative-receives-garfinkel-prize/,0,Scrapes v3,
“4. Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities | Kim Gallon” in “Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016” on Debates in the DH Manifold,"The “black digital humanities” is the intersection between Black studies and digital humanities . Kim Gallon: The black digital humanities help unmask the racialized systems of power at work in how we understand the digital humanities as a field . The field of Black studies is nearing its fiftieth birthday, having developed out of the civil rights and Black Nationalist movements in the late 1960s . There are high stakes for who is and who is not a digital humanist, and for what is or is not digital humanities . Black studies is a scholarly tradition that seeks to restore the humanity of black people lost and stolen through systemic global racialization . This tension is enacted through what I call a “technology of recovery,” characterized by efforts to bring forth the full humanity of marginalized peoples through the use of digital platforms . In addition to Twitter, scholars and institutions (along with nonacademic users) have developed literary and historical digital recovery projects that similarly represent a search and mission for the collective recuperation of a lost peoplehood . Kenton Rambsy, Assistant Professor of African American Literature at the University of Texas at Arlington, models this approach . Neal’s comments touch on the unspoken assumption that African Americans are technophobes, even in the midst of the information age . The supposition that black people are averse to technological innovation is tied to the discourse of “black technophobia” that still circulates today, reproducing and reinforcing long-standing “scientific” evidence of black intellectual inferiority (Everett, 19) Neal: From the vantage of black digital humanities, foundational assumptions about humanity remain deeply entrenched in racialization . The black digital humanities foregrounds the digital as a mutual host for racism and resistance . It brings to light the “role of race as a metalanguage” that shapes the digital terrain . Black digital humanities provides a forum for thinking through the ways that black humanity emerges, submerges, and resurfaces in the digital realm . Black studies has a unique role to play in dismembering how we think about humanity and the digital humanities by extension . A black epistemology will generate questions about the relationship between the racialization of humanity and digital as power .

Guidelines for the Professional Evaluation of Digital Scholarship by Historians | AHA,"Guidelines for the Professional Evaluation of Digital Scholarship by Historians are published by the American Historical Association . The AHA offers a broad working definition of digital history as “scholarship that is either produced using computational tools and methods or presented using digital technologies . Historians must expand their understanding of the rapidly evolving digital environment to take advantage of the possibilities and opportunities it presents . Some digital publication can be nearly indistinguishable from print publication in every respect but its medium . Historians whose expressive and methodological practices differ little from print-era scholars should carry no special burden for explaining why their work appears in digital form . Work done by historians using digital methodologies or media for research, pedagogy, or communication should be evaluated for hiring, promotion, and tenure on its merit . Academic search or promotion process that is described as open to or requiring digitally based scholarship needs to embrace the possible, even the probable, appearance of highly qualified candidates . Digital scholarship should be evaluated in its native digital medium, not printed out for inclusion in review materials . Digital scholarship often includes collaborations, such as co-authored works, undergraduate research, crowdsourcing, and development of tools . The American Historical Association has long sought to advance the possibilities for scholarship in all forms . The AHA will increase its advocacy on several related fronts .",https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/digital-history-resources/evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-in-history/guidelines-for-the-professional-evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-by-historians,0,Scrapes v3,

"ALMAnaCH, Inria","ALMAnaCH organises regular seminars in NLP and digital humanities . No prerequisite in biology is required to attend this seminar . The 21st century is witnessing a major shift in the way people interact with technology . The talk provides deep learning solutions to control style and content in NLG . The talk dives deep into understanding the task of document grounded generation as well as proposing novel solutions for the task . An approach to encode a speech signal into a fixed-size representation minimizes cosine loss with the existing massively multilingual LASER text embedding space . The approach can also be used to directly perform speech-to-speech mining, without the need to first transcribe or translate the data . In this talk I will present the findings of a collaborative audit of multilingual corpora, with special attention for low-resourced languages . With a case study on a subset of African languages I will illustrate the implications of building machine translation on low-quality parallel data . Recent works suggest that it is possible to reduce dependence on labeled data for building speech systems through acoustic representation learning . This talk will present recently proposed methods that could be part of the solution, paving the way for a better NLG . This talk is a subjective walk through my favorite papers and research directions in late-2019/early-2020 . I will present my ongoing research in investigating the learnability of sound correspondences between a proto-language and daughter languages by neural models . Neural and Symbolic Representations of Speech and Language . How to choose the test set size? How to evaluate PoS taggers on the Universal Dependencies project . We provide the first computational treatment of fused-heads constructions (FH), focusing on the numeric fused heads (NFH) FHs constructions are noun phrases (NPs) in which the head noun is missing and is said to be “fused” with its dependent modifier . This missing information is implicit and is important for sentence understanding . We explore the NFH phenomena in large corpora of English text . French Metagrammar (FRMG) is a modular constraint-based representation of syntactic phenomena through classes . We are adapting the FRMG for Old and Middle French because there are enough similarities between these stages of French . We conclude that existing bias removal techniques are insufficient for providing gender-neutral modeling . In this talk, we describe a multi-source trainable parser developed at Lattice for the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task (Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies) The main characteristic of our work is the encoding of three modes of contextual information for parsing . We present “entity-cooking’s”: a generic, Machine Learning-based framework for entity matching/disambiguation . We will present the ongoing work of constructing a 750 000 word treebank for Naija . Kyle Richardson is a finishing PhD student at the University of Stuttgart (IMS) working on semantic parsing and various applications thereof . He’ll be joining the Allen Institute for AI in November . The main topic relates to learning to map input text to full meaning representations from parallel datasets . Analysing linguistic variables measured in individual Twitter streams depend on factors like socioeconomic status, location, time, and the social network of individuals . The use of language is not solely reliant on cognition but is arguably determined by myriad external factors leading to a global variability of linguistic patterns . People of higher socioeconomic status, active to a greater degree during the daytime, use a more standard language . People connected in the social network are closer linguistically than disconnected ones . In the second part of the talk we will discuss how linguistic information and the detected correlations can be used for the inference of socioeconomic status .",https://almanach.inria.fr/seminars-en.html,0,Scrapes v3,

What’s next for the digital humanities? And how might they be part of changing our collective futures? A small number of words appear extremely often, and a very large number appear very rarely . A wealthy eccentric hired Elizebeth Smith to study William Shakespeare’s First Folios . Smith worked, with others her patron hired for the same task, at a facility called Riverbank, which became a school for researching the history of codes . The originator of the detective genre was the 19th-century writer Edgar Allan Poe . Edmond Locard admired the Sherlock Holmes stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; today, Locard is often called the father of modern forensics . To adapt a phrase from Robert Darnton, literature does not merely reflect on history; literature causes history . The arts drive tech so often that it should be a cliché . The art of weaving provided technical inspiration to Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace . Low-art ephemera, like records and zines, shaped the high-tech world for decades . Tech is not separate from poetry and politics . The edition of Ulysses that Hanley used (Random House) contained 260,430 words in total . Poe argued that a human was hiding inside the machine and directing its moves, which was in fact the case . Poe’s argument is an example of inferential reasoning, worked up, in part for literary purposes .

"The Anxiety of Influencers, by Barrett Swanson","Collab houses or TikTok mansions are grotesquely lavish abodes where teens and early twentysomethings live and work together . The houses began to proliferate in impressive if not mind-boggling numbers last spring . In exchange for posting three to five videos per week to the Clubhouse social-media accounts, the boys receive free room and board, plus whatever brand deals they can get based upon their “relevance. ” Baron Scho was living in Galveston, Texas, and studying something called “maritime business” when he started posting videos of himself four or five times a day . Christopher Romero, an angel-faced nineteen-year-old, tells me that he “literally came from nowhere” In some sense, they are like college boys anywhere, except that they live in a seven-thousand-square-foot mansion, a residence whose value is roughly $8 million and whose rent is $35,000 a month . The West Coast is on fire, and the economy is drawing ever closer to a very steep precipice . According to a poll released in 2019, some 54 percent of Americans between the ages of thirteen and thirty-eight would, if given the chance, become a social-media influencer . The influencer marketing industry is projected to be worth $15 billion by 2022 . The average college grad rakes in $50,000 a year, an influencer with more than a million followers could net that much in a month . From a certain vantage, these influencers aren't so much celebrities as they are prototypes of laborers in the new passion economy . Donna Brazile has taught a course called Living in the Digital Age, which mobilizes the techniques of the humanities to interrogate the version of personhood that is being propagated by social networks . The previous semester, for instance, during a class on creative non-fiction, twenty-four of my twenty-six students wrote about self-harm or suicidal ideation . Several of them had been hospitalized for anxiety or depression, Brazile says . The Clubhouse in particular had become a repeated target of Beverly Hills neighbors . Several neighbors in Beverly Hills had filed a report with the local police department claiming that, despite quarantine, Clubhouse BH had hosted a party of “over a hundred” people . FTB influencers DaeDae Wilson and Sam Dezz are also eschewing university despite the fact that both were offered spots on sports teams at top-flight academic institutions . One of the Clubhouse’s founding members, Daisy Keech, relinquished a soccer scholarship at the University of California, Davis, to chase stardom in Los Angeles . Christopher Romero just did a TikTok video for a Louisiana-based chicken franchise called Raising Cane’s,2 for which he and his girlfriend, Madi, were paid $14,000 and $60,000 . The video features no stylized pyrotechnics, no rococo ballet of intricate choreography . The boys know that brands are hunting for the widest possible exposure . Christopher pauses over a number where the TikToker in question turns to the side and, in the manner of a pugilist warding off blows to the head, raises clenched fists over his face and proceeds to thrust his hips blindly . Eventually, Christopher says, “Okay, okay, what about this one? ” The song we choose is “Whole Lotta Choppas” by Sada Baby . A video of Garrett Garrett from Harpers University has already attracted tens of thousands of TikTok viewers . Garrett: ""There is something a little hostile, a little sneering, about a lot of the early comments, sort of in the same rhetorical vein as “Dance, monkey, dance! ” It's clear that their hedonistic coursework doesn’t include the rudiments of critical thinking . ""It is raining ash while we play basketball. On the far side of the house, the boys have a half-court hemmed in by pine trees (plus an adjacent putt-putt course) The boys seemed to regard TikTok as a social and political godsend . They rhapsodize about the app as though it were a conduit for sustained grassroots movements . When Donald Trump proposed banning TikTok last summer, the network had a full-scale existential conniption . Even Taylor Lorenz, the New York Times tech reporter and reigning doyenne of influencer culture, added a panegyric, saying the app has become an information and organizing hub for Gen Z activists and politically minded young people . Any countercultural voltage these influencers purport to possess gets nullified by the fact that they have clear incentives not to talk about controversial matters, lest they get dropped by their brands . The essential premise of the collab-house business model is not far from that of pornographic entertainment . Many TikTok influencers have made the crossover from social media to pornography, using apps such as OnlyFans to post nude pics for their subscribers . This is a chilling contradiction to the claim that TikTok is a platform for authenticity . As our culture continues to conflate the private and public realms, we’ve become cheerfully indentured to the idea that our worth as individuals isn’t our personal integrity or sense of virtue, but our ability to advertise our relevance on the platforms of multinational tech corporations . The two-hour affair is a plein air dinner that recalls nothing so much as a high school homecoming . The influencers Tessa Brooks and Jess Mars keep blowing kisses at each other and saying, at performative volumes, “I miss you, lady ” LZ Granderson: The news has just broken that Oracle, an Austin-based company, was the final bidder for TikTok . LZ: ""Democracy is dying, the university is crumbling, and ash is raining from the sky"" LZ writes that TikTok will continue to be available in the United States . TikTok is a sign of the future, which already feels like a thing of the past . It is the clock counting down our fifteen seconds of fame, the sound the world makes as time is running out .",https://harpers.org/archive/2021/06/tiktok-house-collab-house-the-anxiety-of-influencers/,0,Scrapes v3,

DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly: The Technical Evolution of Vannevar Bush’s Memex,"The Memex was an electro-mechanical device designed in the 1930’s to provide easy access to information stored associatively on microfilm . It is often described as the precursor to hypertext and the web . The Memex was the product of a particular engineering culture . It was the work of George Bush, who wrote about the device in the early 1930s . The design was first published in 1945, at the end of a war effort and with the birth of computers . In the late 1930s and early 1940s, MIT's Analyzer was ‘the most important computer in existence’ in the US’ The Analyzer evaluated and solved equations by mechanical integration . The machine was a huge success which brought prestige and a flood of federal money to MIT and Bush . The Differential Analyzer was designed by MIT's George Bush in 1928 . Bush saw the outline of such a machine in the Product Integraph . Bush decided to make a larger version of the Analyzer in 1930 . In 1936 the Rockefeller Foundation awarded MIT $85,000 to build the Rockefeller Differential Researchers' Analyzer . Harold Hazen, the head of the Electrical Engineering Department in 1940, predicted the Analyzer would “mark the start of a new era in mechanized computing” The Analyzer demonstrated the potential of analogue computing technology for analysis, and engendered an engineering culture around itself that took the machine to be a teacher . Manuel De Landa (1994) puts great emphasis in his work on this connection, particularly as it was further developed during WWII . The Navy came to Bush for advice on machines to crack coding devices like the new Japanese cipher machines . The Comparator was designed to do the hard work of comparing text and letters for the humble human mind . Bush believed it mirrored the operations of “searching” and “associating” on a mechanical level . Bush had developed a fascination with microfilm as an information storage technology . Bush put together a proposal for a new microfilm selection device, based on the architecture of the Comparator, in 1937 . The Selector would search reels of coded microfilm at high speed and which would copy selected frames on the fly, for printout and use . As soon as it was begun, the Selector project drifted away from its original purpose and began to show some telling weaknesses . Bush planned to spin long rolls of 35mm film containing the codes and abstracts past a photoelectric sensing station so fast, at speeds of six feet per second, that 60,000 items could be tested in one minute . The Selector’s scanning station was similar to that used in the Comparator . Microfilm warps under heat and it cannot take great strain or tension without distorting . By 1950, the Analyzer had become an antique, conferred to back-room storage . The reasons The Analyzer fell into disuse were related to a fundamental paradigm shift within computing, from analogue to digital . The period between 1945 and 1967 witnessed enormous change . Warren Weaver expressed his regret over the passing of analogue machines and the 'Analogue Computer' in a letter to the director of MIT's Center of Analysis . Weaver: 'It seems rather a pity not to have around such a place as MIT a really impressive Analogue computer' The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the “association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trailscarried by the cells of the brain” (Bush 1939, 1945, 1967) The major technical problem with human memory was its tendency toward declining . Memex was first and foremost an extension of human memory and the associative .movements that the mind makes through information . Bush transferred this idea into information management . The first Memex design incorporates the technical architecture of the Rapid Selector and the methodology of the Analyzer . The Analyzer was the first large-scale engineering project to combine lower-level, extant technologies and automate what was previously a human cognitive technique: the Integral calculus . In 1939, Bush wrote: “The future means of implementing thought are …worthy of attention by one who wonders what comes next as are new ways of extracting natural resources, or of killing men . George Bush proposed Memex, a machine that would allow the user to access information stored on microfilm by association, not numerical indexing . Bush believed engineers and scientists were the only people who could or should predict the future of technology — anyone else had no idea . 1945 Memex was a piece of furniture from the future, to live in the home of a scientist or an engineer . The user could classify material as it came in front of him using a teleautograph stylus, and register links between different pieces of information using this stylus . The process of making trails was called “trailblazing” and was based on a mechanical provision “whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another” As the human mind moulds the machine, so too the machine “remolds’s trails,” says Bush . Bush believed machines to have their own logic, their own language, which “can’t touch those subtle processes of mind, its logical and rational processes” and alter them . Bush also felt the need to demarcate a purely “human” realm of “creativity” from technics . Memex was not a public database in the sense of the modern Internet: it was first and foremost a private device . The idea of a “personal” machine to amplify the mind flew in the face of the dominant paradigm of human–computer interaction that reached its peak in the late-1950s and early 1960s . In 1945, Memex was a direct analogy to Bush’s conception of human perceptions of memory . In 1967, after digital computing had swept engineering departments across the country into its paradigm, it was still an analogy to human memory . Memex redesigns responded to the advances of the day quite differently to how others were responding .",http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/2/1/000015/000015.html,0,Scrapes v3,

Merck Mercuriadis faces the future… and stares down his critics - Music Business Worldwide,"Merck Mercuriadis founded Hipgnosis Songs Fund in 2018 . Since then, he's bought a slew of blockbuster copyrights, including 50% of Neil Young’s songs; 100% of Lindsey Buckingham’�s hits – and more besides . Some have suggested Hipgnosis's recent $100m share raise was an anti-climax versus the figure they believe Mercuriadis really wanted . He says he's prepared for these ‘inevitable’ attacks – because he’s not here to make friends with anyone other than songwriters . Hipgnosis has raised more than £500 million in equity in just over six months . The company has raised over $1 billion in six months, including leverage, in addition to the $1bn raised in the last year . Hipgnossy says it is a misconception that Hipgnos were trying to raise £605 million . Steve Cooper was involved in launching a $650 million fund with Tempo, and yet I've never once felt Tempo in literally any of the deals we’ve made . Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac were nowhere on both deals . That's not Steve Cooper’s fault; that's the fault of the people in place at Tempo . ‘My intention has always been to buy and hold these catalogs, that’s how both my shareholders and songwriters win. ‘Everything I laid out as the core of our thesis has come true – exactly as predicted – or been exceeded. ” Hipgnosis is a FTSE 250 company and eventually wants to be a 100-FTSE 100 company . ‘Every one of our acquisitions has to be valued by an independent valuer, and that valuation has to bear out the price that we pay’ The songwriter is buying up catalogs whose ownership is expiring from major music companies . Songwriters are delivering the most important component to a record company – hits . Songwriters are delivering the most important component to a record company – hits . No one can argue that the economics of music today reflect the songwriter’s role fairly and equitably . Songwriter says he is critical of Universal, Warner, and Sony because of the detrimental effect it's had on the earnings of the songwriting community . He says he's working hard to give the market more disclosure of each artist asset sale . Hipgnosis has not disclosed what they’ve paid for individual artist/writer catalogs like Collective Soul, The Cult, or Jim Vallance . Hipgnossy says Massarsky is the independent valuer for our NAV [net asset value] only . Hipgnosis is being valued using the same metrics that Universal were when they were worth €20 billion . Vivendi just three years ago Vivendi had just revalued Universal from €6bn to €20bn . Hipgnossa’s investors want to know, ultimately, is the overall value of our portfolio . Hipgnosis has raised £1.3 billion in just three years and is now worth £500 million . The company has been criticised for raising money through share issues . But he says he gets higher management fees each time we raise more money . Hipgnosis will continue buying at the rate that we’re currently buying for the next two years . At that point in time we will end up being somewhere around a £3 billion, getting close to £4 billion, company . At the end of that period, the buying is going to start being far less of what we do .

Is Universal Music Worth $29 Billion? $49 Billion? Even $100 Billion? - Rolling Stone,"Universal Music Group parent company Vivendi is considering a proposal to “spin out” 60% of the world’s biggest music company onto the Amsterdam Stock Exchange at an undefined point in 2021 .

Morgan Stanley analysts say UMG could now carry a “fair value” worth of around $49 billion . In a research note issued last month, Kerven pointed out that he had long maintained UMG’s value was higher than €40 billion .

Epic Qualities in Moby-Dick - UNT Digital Library,"Many critics not satisfied with explaining Moby-Dick in terms of the novel, have sough analogies in other literary genres.

International Workers’ Order (IWO) and Jewish People's Fraternal Order (JPFO) | Cornell University Library Digital Collections,"Bilingual project conserves, digitizes, curates, and curates* a portion of Cornell’s International Workers Order (IWO) archives . The IWO was founded in 1930 as an immigrant fraternal order that provided high-quality, low-cost health and burial insurance and other benefits for members . The origins arose from a decade of splits (1920-1930) concerning the Bolshevik Revolution and Communism that consumed the Jewish Federation of Socialists and the Arbeter Ring . The JPFO organizational files supply a detailed, albeit incomplete, record regarding the history of a U.S. immigrant fraternal organization that promoted Soviet-aligned secular Yiddish culture as it navigated some of the twentieth century’s thorniest political currents . The IWO Records offer a potentially rich vein for advancing that goal . Papers arrived at the Kheel Center Archives between 1960 and 2002 . They offer official articulations of what it meant to be an immigrant fraternal organization . The case raised the question as to whether the IWO was in fact a bone fide fraternal order, since its political activities were clearly interwoven into its framework as a fraternal mutual benefits society with affiliated lodges . The JPFO's activities during the war years reflect left-wing Jewish responses to shifts in Soviet policy . These encouraged the JPFO not only to fully support the war, but to put together a “Jewish Unity” front . The emphasis on producing and being part of “Yidishe Kultur” (Yiddish Culture) is described in these papers as part of an ideology connected to ethnic pride . The JPFO’s intensive and well-documented campaign for postwar “rehabilitation and relief” efforts was geared to supporting Jewish community, and especially orphanages . The archives touch deeply on topics of interest to scholars, students and prospective researchers of labor, Jewish life and education, international relations, the Cold War, race relations and race relations . Other pertinent topics include Palestine/Israel, folk music, summer camps such as Camp Kinderland and JPFO schools (Shule) Yiddish speaking immigrants generally chose their own English surnames, often used commonly transliterated spellings as part of a process of immigrant acculturation . Most did not employ YIVO’s system to determine the spelling of their names or those of many words . The total 5276 International Workers' Order collection is 42. 4 linear feet . The curated selection is 5 linear feet, including a few bound volumes . Material exists on extensive IWO / JPFO legal and political campaigns that involved national historic figures . We gratefully acknowledge the support of Cornell’s Grants Program for Digital Collections .",https://digital.library.cornell.edu/collections/iwo-jpfo,0,Scrapes v3,

It investigates why politicians collaborate across party lines in the Australian Parliament and how this relates to political representation . CPC rose to prominence when it was used to achieve legislative change in 2006 by four women Senators . This thesis identifies CPC as a form of representation which provides a means of opening debate over hitherto ignored and/or contested issues in the political realm . It allows a wider variety of views to be represented by offering an alternative way to agitate for policy change . As parliament has become more volatile, CPC is increasingly recognised by politicians as a useful strategy to represent issues .",https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/120377,0,Scrapes v3,

How to Write a Hit Song: 7 Innovative Methods to Improve Your Songwriting,"Songwriting is a fine art composed of many finely tuned muscles alongside a high level of skill and craft . When songwriters really want to turn professional, they start writing, every day .

In my Signature Songwriting Circle we teach artists the power of writing from their life experiences resulting in emotionally compelling songs laced with their authenticity . We find that when a real-life experience is at the core of the concept it holds more relatability and more emotion for the artist . One Republic frontman Ryan Tedder says what makes a good hook is a simple concept with a simple melody and a basic human concept that hasn’t been said before . A unique angle was Adele’s song that made it a world-wide hit . Songwriters can identify the sound, direction and tempo of the song before they put their hands on an instrument . Pick a track that emulates or has the essence of what you hear in your head .

44 Tips from a Real Celebrity Vocal Coach 2021,"Cari Cole Voice + Music Company, we train singers to master their voices using our Cole Vocal Method™ . We also coach them to become great performers and recording artists . Here are my 44 top tips for How to Sing Better . Find Your Vocal Range on the Piano video below also jot down the notes where your voice shift or “breaks” Write your vocal range down: Lowest note and the highest, example: G2 to E6 . The back of your tongue is the number one reason for nasality and problems with transitions through the “break” and a tight tense voice . Try dropping your tongue down when singing vowels . The voice first has to be strong and flexible, secondly it has to have a good ear, and third, the experience and phrasing to deliver emotion, plus the ability to show feelings and vulnerability . Are you a sultry power ballad singer ala Adele or Ellie Goulding? Or a waif-like breathy goddess ala Cat Power or Feist? Or is your power in falsetto like James Vincent McMorrow or Bon Iver? Or are you a soulful blues dude like James Bay or Jack Garratt? Finding your own sound is a process of making your voice fit you like a glove . It can take days, weeks, months or years to come into your own style . Singing is a form of meditation and can help us breathe, focus and stay present . Vocal warm-ups are one of the key essentials to protecting yourself from injuries such as vocal nodules (nodes) or polyps . Warm up your singing voice with the right vocal warmups . Vocal Cool Downs are a way to condition your vocal cords and reduce inflammation after a big performance . They can also be used as a warmup for voices that have more issues or take longer to warm up . The #1 cause of food related voice loss is laryngeal reflux . Avoid foods like marinara sauce, chocolate, peppermint and don’t eat 2 hours before bed . Allergies also play a role in vocal problems . Cole Vocal Method: Find your unique signature style and find the right genre for you . Singing with a good technical voice, it’s another to sing with great emotion . The best way to improve your vocal performance requires that you learn to juggle both balls in the air at once . Don’t just wait for the studio to record your voice, you should record as often as possible . The beauty of this process, as technical as it is, is that it will improve your ear tenfold . A technique or trick to deepening your emotional connection to the song is to speak the lyric out loud like an actor doing a monologue .

Mainstream popular music research: a musical update | Popular Music | Cambridge Core,"The concept of the mainstream has often only been used to demarcate, rather vaguely, the binary other to the authentic, honest, subversive, and creative . The different ways in which it is being defined and what side of it is brought to the fore depend strongly on the particular Mainstream popular music does not refer to a coherent musical category in the form of, for example, a defined genre characterised by distinct formal, technical, semiotic, social or other ‘rules’ Mainstream music is music that is discredited as being ‘banal Mainstream popular music is a praxis formation of producing and perceiving music that incorporates specific ways of collective thinking and action as well as underlying logics . It is a specific ‘discursive framework’ in Lee Marshall's terms, giving listeners ‘the tools to Mainstream popular music often carries image of being polished, pre-processed, cut-and-dried, overproduced and removed of any edge whatsoever . Such attributions relate more strongly to how the songs were produced than to their inherent aesthetic qualities . Music takes function of a more general cultural evaluation surface on which society negotiates its dominant conceptions, narratives and ideologies . Mainstream popular music can be analysed as a society's loudest but most provisional stage on which to perform or contest normativity . The section starts with a relatively lengthy, critical reflection of quantitative big data examinations and continues with a discussion of music-theoretical perspectives . The second section emphasises research in which the audiences of post-2000 mainstream popular music is the focus (listener-based analysis) According to Schellenberg and von Scheve's findings, there was an increasing emergence of minor mode and slower tempos during the 1965–2009 period on Billboard's Top 40 charts . Successful songs seem to defy this downward trend in mood, as they display a tendency to be Big data analyses do little to support our knowledge of why certain trends and transitions have happened and how they connected to broader contexts . The global 2017 hit ‘Despacito’ is not necessarily a sad song, nor is LMFAO's ‘Party Rock Anthem’ The scope of popular music analysis has expanded beyond its traditional focus, which used to be primarily the sounds of (classic and progressive) rock music and the Beatles . 21st century commercial pop music is still little represented as a research subject in this field . New song forms in the ‘current pop mainstream’ featuring single-loop repetitions, post-choruses and ‘pop drops’ are shown in an ongoing corpus analysis project that examines the Billboard Year End Top 10 from 2006 to 2016 . A lack of production-based theoretical analysis that considers in detail ‘the technical aspects of a song's production’ is certainly an issue in popular music analysis in general . Robin Attas remarks that to study phrase rhythm in such mainstream artists as Sarah McLachlan is to miss 21st century hit-records’ music often is given only short shrift in recent publications on sound and recording issues in popular culture . For example, Immanuel Brockhaus analyses prototypical, ‘iconic’ sounds in music from the Billboard charts (1966– There seems to be more interest in how mainstream popular music's sounds are made on the edge of academic and journalistic work . An extensive source for hit-songs’ analysis is the platform songlexikon. de, which is published by the University of Freiburg . There has been a rising awareness in popular music analysis of the reflection of the analyst's subjectivity in hearing, experiencing and interpreting music . Popular music musicologists are usually not among those who make mainstream popular music an essential part of their cultural practices and aesthetic experiences . Mainstream popular music analysis and music-oriented emotion studies generally turn out to be a rather bad match . Recent studies concerned with a vast amount of songs from the UK or US charts in connection with notions of emotion and mood are rarely or not at all in the studies on music and Emery Schubert: 'There exists a general aversion to the study of emotion in pop music from the listener's perspective' Herbert and Dibben show that 10- to 18-year-old listeners are likely to claim ownership of a ‘four-chord pop The different approaches that I have outlined in this article reveal – or potentially might reveal – various facets of 21st century mainstream popular music's sounds from diverse perspectives . However, owing to these (and other) approaches’ diversity, the research field presents itself as quite fragmented .
