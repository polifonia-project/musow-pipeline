495,chordify annotator subjectivity dataset,"reference annotation datasets containing single harmony annotations are at the core of a wide range of studies in music information retrieval and related fields. however, a lot of properties of music are subjective, and annotator subjectivity found among multiple reference annotations is (usually) not taken into account. currently available chord-label annotation datasets containing more than one reference annotation are limited by size, sampling strategy, or lack of a standardized encoding. therefore, to advance research into annotator subjectivity and computational harmony (such as automatic chord estimation), we release the chordify annotator subjectivity dataset (casd), containing multiple expert reference annotations. this respository releases the chordify annotator subjectivity dataset, containing reference annotations for: (pip) install the jams python module to read the annotations. to work with the annotations, load an annotation file: to access the annotations from the first annotator: for further details on how to manupulate and work with jams files, we refer to the jams documentation. we find that within the casd, annotators disagree about chord labels. the next figure gives a nice intuitive idea of the disagreement.  this figure shows the chromagram of the annotators for song 92 in the dataset. the horizontal axis represents time, the vertical axis represents the 12 pitch classes of a single octave. the figure shows that the annotators differ in level of detail in time, as well as in pitch classes per chord. this figure was generated with this script. if you are interested in a detailed analysis of the annotator subjectivity found in the casd, please refer to our publication in the journal of new music research: hendrik vincent koops, w. bas de haas, john ashley burgoyne, jeroen bransen, anna kent-muller & anja volk (2019) annotator subjectivity in harmony annotations of popular music, journal of new music research, 48:3, 232-252, doi: 10.1080/09298215.2019.1613436 please cite this publication if you use the casd in your research. by way of this repository and jams, we encourage the music information retrieval community to exchange, update, and expand the dataset. we are more than happy to add your annotations to this dataset. if you are interested in contributing, please keep in mind how these annotations were obtained (see: data collection method below). using the same data collection methods ensures keeping all the annotations in the dataset uniform and comparable. to contribute, submit a pull request. please send us an email for questions if you have questions on our code of conduct, of if the process for submitting pull requests is unclear. to ensure the annotators were all focused on the same task, we provided them
with a guideline for the annotating process. we asked them to listen to the
songs as if they wanted to play the song on their instrument in a band, and to
transcribe the chords with this purpose in mind. they were instructed to
assume that the band would have a rhythm section (drum and bass) and melody
instrument (e.g., a singer). therefore, their goal was to transcribe the
complete harmony of the song in a way that, in their view, best matched their
instrument. we used a web interface to provide the annotators with a central, unified
transcription method. this interface provided the annotators with a grid of
beat-aligned elements, which we manually verified for correctness. chord
labels could be chosen for each beat. the standard youtube web player was used
to provide the reference recording of the song. through the interface, the
annotators were free to select any chord of their choice for each beat. while
transcribing, the annotators were able to watch and listen not only to the
youtube video of the song, but also a synthesized version of their chord
transcription. in addition to providing chords and information about their musical background,
we asked the annotators to provide for each song a difficulty rating on a scale
of 1 (easy) to 5 (hard), the amount of time it took them to annotate the song in
minutes, and any remarks they might have on the transcription process. the chordify annotator subjectivity dataset was introduced at the late breaking session at the 18th international society for music information retrieval conference. for more information about the casd and annotator subjectivity in this dataset, please find the poster and extended abstract below. 
 in a paper published in the journal of new music research, we provide background information and a statistical analysis of annotator subjectivity in the casd:  questions can be addressed to casd@chordify.net.

multi-label genre annotations from different metadata sources. it allows researchers to explore how the same music pieces are annotated differently by different communities following their own genre taxonomies, and how this could be addressed by genre recognition systems. with this dataset, we hope to contribute to developments in content-based music genre recognition as well as cross-disciplinary studies on genre metadata analysis. genre labels for the dataset are sourced from both expert annotations and crowds, permitting comparisons between strict hierarchies and folksonomies. music features are available via the acousticbrainz database. we provide four datasets containing genre and subgenre annotations extracted from four different online metadata sources. these genre datasets were created using as a source four different music metadata websites. their genre taxonomies vary in class spaces, specificity and breadth. each source has its own definition for its genre labels meaning that these labels may be different between sources. allmusic and discogs are based on editorial metadata databases maintained by music experts and enthusiasts. these sources contain explicit genre/subgenre annotations of music releases (albums) following a predefined genre namespace and taxonomy. we propagated release-level annotations to recordings (tracks) in acousticbrainz to build the datasets. lastfm and tagtraum are based on collaborative music tagging platforms with large amounts of genre labels provided by their users for music recordings (tracks). we have automatically inferred a genre/subgenre taxonomy and annotations from these labels. importantly, annotations in the datasets are multi-label. there may be multiple genre and subgenre annotations for the same music recording. it is guaranteed that each recording has at least one genre label, while subgenres are not always present. the resulting genre metadata is licensed under cc by-nc-sa4.0 license, except for data extracted from the allmusic database, which is released for non-commercial scientific research purposes only. any publication of results based on the data extracts of the allmusic database must cite allmusic as the source of the data. for details on format and contents, please refer to the data webpage. details on the genre/subgenre taxonomies and their distributions  are  reported here. the dataset can be used within the context of the mgr task to develop systems that predict genre and subgenre of unknown music recordings (songs) given automatically computed features of those recordings. we provide four training sets and four validation sets with all data publicly available,  and four test sets with a hidden ground truth.  the training and validation sets can be used for the evaluation of mgr systems. the test sets do not include a publicly available ground truth and have anonymized mbids; they are reserved to be used in future mgr challenges such as mediaeval 2017/2018. nevertheless, it is possible to run an evaluation on the test sets upon request. using our data for this task may serve as an example of the development and validation of automatic annotation algorithms on complementary datasets with different taxonomies and coverage. the code for baseline approach is available in this repository. if you use the mediaeval acousticbrainz genre dataset or part of it, please cite our ismir 2019 overview paper: acousticbrainz, audio commons, tagtraum industries and trompa  this research has received funding from the european union's horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreements no 688382 (audiocommons) and 770376-2 (trompa), as well as the ministry of economy and competitiveness of the spanish government

497,aligned scores and performances (asap) dataset,"asap is a dataset of aligned musical scores (both midi and musicxml) and performances (audio and midi), all with downbeat, beat, time signature, and key signature annotations. this repository contains all of the annotations, as well as all of the midi and musicxml files. to get the audio files, follow the instructions below. the audio files are not distributed in this repository. to obtain them: the script has been tested in windows, linux and mac os with python 3.6, and the libraries librosa v0.7.2 and pandas v1.0.3. if you use this dataset in any research, please cite the relevant paper: asap  contains  236  distinct  musical  scores  and  1067  performances  of  western  classical  piano  music from 15 different composers (see table below for a breakdown). scores and performances are distributed in a folder system structured as composer/subgroup/piece where the piece directory contains the xml and midi score, plus all of the performances of a specific piece. subgroup contains additional hierarchies (e.g., bach contains subgroups fugues and preludes). a metadata csv file is available in the main folder with  information about file correspondances, and the title and composer of each performance. annotations are given in tab-separated-values (tsv) files in the same folder as each performances, named as {basename(file)}_annotations.txt. these tsv  files can be read by audacity (file->import->labels) to view the annotations on a corresponding audio perfomance. paired midi and audio performances correspond to the same annotation file since they are exactly aligned. a single json in the main folder also contains all of the annotation information for every file in asap. it is possible that 2 versions of the same piece are in different folders if they refer to slighlty different scores (e.g. different repetitions in the performance). even in this case, the composer and title in the metadata table will be the same for both performances. for the applications where unique pieces are needed (e.g., to create a training/test dataset with not overlapping) look for the unique couple (title,composer). note that this is not the same as considering all the unique xml-score names, since in order to deal with different repetitions in performances, 2 different xml-scores may refer to the same piece (e.g., ""beethoven/piano_sonatas/17_1/xml_score.musicxml"" and ""beethoven/piano_sonatas/17_1_no_repeat/xml_score.musicxml""). each row in metadata.csv file contains the following information: in asap_annotations.json the first group of keys are the path of the midi performance files in asap.
every performance has the following keys: for each performance and midi score we provide a tab-separated value (tsv) file of the position (in seconds) of each beat, downbeat, time signature change, and key signature change.  these files can be read by audacity to view the annotations on a corresponding audio perfomance. each line in the tsv file begins with 2 identical columns containing the time in seconds corresponding to the annotation, followed by a 3rd column containing the label: the scores were written by non-professionals, and although we manually corrected them to filter out most of the incorrect notation, they still present some problems. our suggestion is to use the corrected annotations provided in the tsv and in the json files rather than extracting them again from the score. in certain cases (e.g., pickup measures in the middle of the score, rubato measures, complex embellishments) it is not possible to estabilish the position of the beat from the score. in our annotations we choose to mark those beats as ""br"". 30 performances are not aligned with the score. the cause is an incomplete performance or the player missing some beats due to a mistake. altough not good for amt and score production, those performances were manually checked and are still usable for beat/downbeat tracking. this information is in the json file. we created this dataset to target mir tasks such as beat/downbeat tracking, key signature estimation, time signature estimation. we haven't explored other tasks such as voice separation, beaming/tuplet creation, and expressive performance rendering. it is surely possible to perform them with the information from the xml-scores and our alignment, but we haven't tested if the data is of a sufficient quality for those tasks. the dataset is made available under a creative commons attribution non-commercial share-alike 4.0 (cc by-nc-sa 4.0) license.",https://github.com/fosfrancesco/asap-dataset/blob/master/readme.md,1
498,ballroom beat and bar annotations,"this data set includes beat and bar annotations of the ballroom dataset, introduced by gouyon et al. [1]. it does not include the audio files. the audio files (698 files, size 1.5 gb) can be downloaded from:

the link to the data set is broken, please use http://mtg.upf.edu/ismir2004/contest/tempocontest/data1.tar.gz instead.
md5sum of the file data1.tar.gz: 2872a3e52070bc342a4510a95e2fa0b8 note: according to bob sturm (http://media.aau.dk/null_space_pursuits/2014/01/ballroom-dataset.html) there are four exact and nine recording replicas within the dataset. these include: the annotations consist of .beats files that contain the beat and bar annotations in the following format:
beat time in sec beat id
e.g., 9.430022675	3
means the third beat of a bar is located at 9.43 seconds. if you are looking for downbeats, extract all beats with id = 1. it is a well known problem that annotators disagree on the metrical level of a musical piece. in this dataset we relied on the tempo restrictions that are given by the dance style label of the ballroom dances. we therefore chose the metrical level of the beats according to the tempo ranges taken from:
http://www.ballroomdancers.com/dances/ intros that do not contain any musical content have not been annotated, and should not be taken into account in the evaluation. the dataset was annotated using two stages: first, we used a beat tracker [2] to interpolate the (manual) bar annotations kindly provided by simon dixon and used in [3]. then, we manually adjusted and corrected the interpolated beat times. note that the annotations are stored in a versioning system, which allows us to update the annotations from time to time while keeping track of older versions. whenever new errors in the annotations are identified and resolved (i am sure there are still some), we will create a new tag in the git repo and commit the changes. in order to assure the reproducibility of your results, it would also be advisable to include the tags into your publications. we strongly encourage everybody to report errors in the dataset to
florian krebs florian.krebs@jku.at. we would like to thank simon dixon who supplied us with his annotations of the first bar of each piece. [1] gouyon f., a. klapuri, s. dixon, m. alonso, g. tzanetakis, c. uhle, and p.

each gz contains the annotations of a particular song.
we use a unique id for each entry.
you can download your dali_data version as follow: this function can also be used to load a subset of the dali dataset by providing the ids of the entries you either want to skip or to keep. note: loading dali might take some minutes depending on your computer and python version. python3 is faster than python2. additionally, each dali version contains a dali_data_info.gz: this file matches the unique dali id with the artist_name-song_tile, the url to youtube and a bool that says if the youtube link is working or not. dali_data is a dictionary where each key is a unique id and the value is an instance of the class dali/annotations namely an annotation instance of the class annotations. each annotation instance has two attributes: info and annotations. you can export and import annotations a json file. each dali_data has its own ground-truth ground-truth file.
the annotations that are part of the ground-truth are entries of the dali_data with the offset and fr parameters manually annotated. you can easily load a ground-truth file: you can also load a dali_gt with all the entries of the dali_data that are part of the ground-truth with their annotations updated to the offset and fr parameters manually annotated: you can also load the whole dali_data and update the songs that are part of the ground truth with the offset and fr parameters manually verified. note 1: please be sure you have the last ground truth version. you can retrieve the audio for each annotation (if avilable) using the function dali_code.get_audio(): this function can also be used to download a subset of the dali dataset by providing the ids of the entries you either want to skip or to keep. annotations are in: entry.annotations['annot'] and they are presented in two different formats: 'horizontal' or 'vertical'.
you can easily change the format using the functions: in this format each level of granularity is stored individually.
it is the default format.  each level contains a list of annotation where each element has: you can export the annotations of each individual level to a xml or text file to vizualize them with audacity or audiosculpt. the pitch information is only presented in the xml files for audiosculpt. this format is ment to be use for working with each level individually. example 1: recovering the main vocal melody. let's used the extra function dali_code.annot2vector() that transforms the annotations into a vector. there are two types of vector: type='voice': each frame has a value 1 or 0 for voice or not voice. type='melody': each frame has the freq value of the main vocal melody. note: have a look to dali_code.annot2vector_chopping() for computing a vector chopped with respect to a given window and hop size. example 2: find the audio frames that define each paragraph. let's used the other extra function dali_code.annot2frames() that transforms time in seconds into time in frames. note: dali_code.annot2frames() can also be used in the vertical format but not dali_code.annot2vector(). in this format the different levels of granularity are hierarchically connected:  each element of the list is a paragraph.  where 'text' contains all the lines of the paragraph. each line follows the same format:  again, each word contains all the notes for that word to be sung:  only the deepest level directly has the text information. you can always get the text at specific point with dali_code.get_text(), i.e: this organization is meant to be used for working with specific hierarchical blocks. example 1: working only with the third paragraph. additionally, you can easily retrieve all its individual information with the function dali_code.unroll(): example 2: working only with the first line of the third paragraph up to now, we are facing only global alignment problems. you can change this alignment by modifying the offset and frame rate parameters. the original ones are stored at: if you find a better parameters set you can modified the annotations using the function dali_code.change_time(): we encourage you to send us your parameters in order to improve dali. you can contact us at: dali dot dataset at gmail dot com this research has received funding from the french national research agency under the contract anr-16-ce23-0017-01 (wasabi project) this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike 4.0 international license.",https://github.com/gabolsgabs/dali/blob/master/readme.md,1
500,da-tacos,"we present da-tacos: a dataset for cover song identification and understanding. it contains two subsets, namely the benchmark subset (for benchmarking cover song identification systems) and the cover analysis subset (for analyzing the links among cover songs), with pre-extracted features and metadata for 15,000 and 10,000 songs, respectively. the annotations included in the metadata are obtained with the api of secondhandsongs.com. all audio files we use to extract features are encoded in mp3 format and their sample rate is 44.1 khz. da-tacos does not contain any audio files. for the results of our analyses on modifiable musical characteristics using the cover analysis subset and our initial benchmarking of 7 state-of-the-art cover song identification algorithms on the benchmark subset, you can look at our publication. for organizing the data, we use the structure of secondhandsongs where each song is called a 'performance', and each clique (cover group) is called a 'work'. based on this, the file names of the songs are their unique performance ids (pid, e.g. p_22), and their labels with respect to their cliques are their work ids (wid, e.g. w_14). metadata for each song includes in addition, we matched the original metadata with musicbrainz to obtain musicbrainz id (mbid), song length and genre/style tags. we would like to note that musicbrainz related information is not available for all the songs in da-tacos, and since we used just our metadata for matching, we include all possible mbids for a particular songs. for facilitating reproducibility in cover song identification (csi) research, we propose a framework for feature extraction and benchmarking in our supplementary repository: acoss. the feature extraction component is designed to help csi researchers to find the most commonly used features for csi in a single address. the parameter values we used to extract the features in da-tacos are shared in the same repository. moreover, the benchmarking component includes our implementations of 7 state-of-the-art csi systems. we provide the performance results of an initial benchmarking of those 7 systems on the benchmark subset of da-tacos. we encourage other csi researchers to contribute to acoss with implementing their favorite feature extraction algorithms and their csi systems to build up a knowledge base where csi research can reach larger audiences. the instructions for how to download and use the dataset are shared below. please contact us if you have any questions or requests. we provide two metadata files that contain information about the benchmark subset and the cover analysis subset. both metadata files are stored as python dictionaries in .json format, and have the same hierarchical structure. an example to load the metadata files in python: the python dictionary obtained with the code above will have the respective wids as keys. each key will provide the song dictionaries that contain the metadata regarding the songs that belong to their wids. an example can be seen below: the list of features included in da-tacos can be seen below. all the features are extracted with acoss repository that uses open-source feature extraction libraries such as essentia, librosa, and madmom. to facilitate the use of the dataset, we provide two options regarding the file structure. 1- in da-tacos_benchmark_subset_single_files and da-tacos_coveranalysis_subset_single_files folders, we organize the data based on their respective cliques, and one file contains all the features for that particular song. 2- in da-tacos_benchmark_subset_feature and da-tacos_coveranalysis_subset_feature folders, the data is organized based on their cliques as well, but each of these folders contain only one feature per song. for instance, if you want to test your system that uses hpcp features, you can download da-tacos_benchmark_subset_hpcp to access the pre-computed hpcp features. an example for the contents in those files can be seen below: the dataset is currently stored in only in google drive (it will be uploaded to zenodo soon), and can be downloaded from this link. we also provide a python script that automatically downloads the folders you specify. basic usage of this script can be seen below: all files (except the metadata) are stored in .h5 format. we recommend using deepdish library for python to load the files. an example of how to load the data is shown below: please cite the following publication when using the dataset: furkan yesiler, chris tralie, albin correya, diego f. silva, philip tovstogan, emilia gómez, and xavier serra. da-tacos: a dataset for cover song identification and understanding. in proc. of the 20th int. soc. for music information retrieval conf.

international society for music information retrieval conference (ismir), 2017. we introduce the free music archive (fma), an open and easily accessible
dataset suitable for evaluating several tasks in mir, a field concerned with
browsing, searching, and organizing large music collections. the community's
growing interest in feature and end-to-end learning is however restrained by
the limited availability of large audio datasets. the fma aims to overcome
this hurdle by providing 917 gib and 343 days of creative commons-licensed
audio from 106,574 tracks from 16,341 artists and 14,854 albums, arranged in
a hierarchical taxonomy of 161 genres. it provides full-length and
high-quality audio, pre-computed features, together with track- and
user-level metadata, tags, and free-form text such as biographies. we here
describe the dataset and how it was created, propose a train/validation/test
split and three subsets, discuss some suitable mir tasks, and evaluate some
baselines for genre recognition. code, data, and usage examples are available
at https://github.com/mdeff/fma. all metadata and features for all tracks are distributed in fma_metadata.zip (342 mib).
the below tables can be used with pandas or any other data analysis tool.
see the paper or the usage.ipynb notebook for a description. then, you got various sizes of mp3-encoded audio data: see the wiki (or #41) for known issues (errata). the following notebooks, scripts, and modules have been developed for the dataset.

505,musooevaluator,"an evaluator for music label sequences based on the musoo library musooevaluator has only one dependency, the boost libraries (version >= 1.46.0). if it has been installed in a non-standard location, two environment variables have been defined such that no hard-coded paths need to be changed in the build systems. just set compiled_libraries_include and compiled_libraries_lib to the include and library folders containing the boost libraries and you're good to go. build systems for multiple platforms are included in the build folder additional build systems can be generated using premake and the premake4.lua file in the build directory. the files to be evaluated can either be expressed as single files or as a list of files. single file mode takes the options --reffile <file-path> and --testfile <file-path> to specify the path to the reference file and the file under test. for list mode, you need to create a text file with the base names (without extensions) of a data set separated by newlines. these base names can contain relative folders as well. you pass the path to this list file with --list <list-path>. then you specify the reference and test directories that get prepended to the base names with --refdir <dir-path> and --testdir <dir-path> respectively, as well as the suffixes that get appended with --refext <suffix> and --testext <suffix>. both input modes can restrict the evaluation to a subsection of the files. this can be done globally for all files using the options --begin <time> or --end <time> or on a per file basis by passing a text file that contains the start and end times separated by whitespace. these timing files should be passed with the options --timingfile <file-path>, or --timingdir <dir-path> and --timingext <suffix>, depending on the input mode. the time is in all cases expressed in seconds. by default the evaluation is carried out over the entire duration of the reference file. exactly how the two sequences of music labels will be compared depends on what they represent. furthermore, for each type of label, a number of presets are defined that offer different ways of comparing the sequences. the music labels can either represent chords, keys or notes. the labels can be completely ignored as well and then an evaluation based just on the segmentation will be performed. for key labels, there is a special ""global key"" mode that first takes the key with the longest total duration in the file (in case there is more than one) before passing on to the evaluation. you select the desired content mode by specifying the correspoding option out of --chords <preset-name>, --keys <preset-name>, --globalkey <preset-name>, --notes <preset-name> or --segmentation <preset-name> on the command line. a description of the exact methods of comparison they represent can be found in the icassp1 paper on chord evaluation and the mirex website2. currently there is only one preset, piano, available which compares notes in the piano range (midi notes 21 to 89) and considers them correct if they are enharmonically  equal to the reference note. these presets are referring to a work in process that does not write output yet. for now, all of them return the same directional hamming measure and over-segmentaton and under-segmentation values. the exact options that were used for the 2013 iccasp paper1 are --chords mirex2010, --chords triads, --chords tetrads, --chords triadsinput, --chords tetradsonly, --chords root, --chords bass, --chords chromarecall, --chords chromaprecision.
the exact options that were used in the mirex 2013 ace2 evaluation campaign were --chords mirexmajmin, --chords mirexmajminbass, --chords mirexsevenths, --chords mirexseventhsbass, --chords mirexroots and --segmentation inner. a result file with a score for the entire data set specified as input is written to the path given by --output <file-path>. its output is a human readable summary that depends on the content mode, but if you add the option --csv, you get a comma separated value file in the same directory as the output file with separate results for each of the input files. for the ""chords"", ""keys"", ""globalkey"" and ""notes"" content modes, you can also get a confusion matrix by specifying --confusion <path>. finally, for these same content modes, you can specify the --verbose option to get an idea what exactly is going on. it will write a file per input in the output directory in which the different steps of the score calculation are broken down. all the reference-test segment pairs are enumerated, with original labels, mapped labels, segment duration and whether or it is included in the evaluation. this gives a sort of ""paper trail"" that shows how the score is calculated so that it is easy to verify by hand and understand what exactly is going on. johan pauwels and geoffroy peeters, evaluating automatically estimated chord sequences, proceedings of the ieee international conference on audio, speech and signal processing (icassp), 2013. ↩ ↩2 mirex 2013 automatic chord estimation task ↩ ↩2 fred lerdahl, tonal pitch space, oxford university press, 2001 ↩",https://github.com/mtg/musooevaluator/blob/master/readme.md,1

(2009), produce full structural analyses, segmenting the piece into large-scale sections and providing group labels. the other two, mestres (2007) and the ""analyze"" method of the echo nest api, perform only the segmentation step, producing a list of boundaries between the sections of a piece. access to these algorithms was kindly provided by the following researchers: luke barrington at ucsd computer audition laboratory provided the code for his algorithm, with assistance from emanuele coviello. the evaluation of xavier janer mestres' segmentation algorithm was carried out by nicholas wack and emilia gómez at universitat pompeu fabra. ewald peiszer has made his algorithm and many of his previous results available online. mark levy has implemented his and mark sandler's algorithm as a vamp plugin for sonic visualiser, both of which are free to download. finally, tristan jehan and brian whitman, founders of the echonest, allow free public use of their analysis tools via a developer api. i am grateful for all of the above researchers and inspired by their willingness to share. the five analysis algorithms were fed the songs listed in the audio data section; in the case of the three full structure analysis algorithms, several combinations of parameters were tested, shown in the table below. the output of the algorithms is provided here as a 17 mb archive, the contents of which are organized by algorithm, corpus, album, and piece. the different outputs using different parameters for a single piece are all contained in a single folder, with the parameters embedded in the filename. it is hoped that by sharing this information, other researchers who find fault with my evaluation procedure or who conceive of new evaluation procedures may incorporate this data into their study. after all, it is a far more painstaking affair to obtain and operate algorithms than it is to evaluate them; since reusing this data is the easy part, it would seem a waste not to invite others to do so.",https://github.com/jblsmith/ma-thesis/blob/master/readme.md,1

508,m-djcue,"a manually annotated dataset of cue points as part of our research, we are curating a dataset that currently contains annotations for 134 tracks of electronic dance music (edm), selected from a period of 30 years (1987–2016) and a variety of musical subgenres; about 60% of the tracks come from the digitalization of vinyls. we believe that this dataset makes it possible to evaluate the quality of cue points estimation algorithms in an objective, fast, and easy manner. see our poster and abstract from imsir 2019: 
 
 
 all the annotations are in jams format. each file consists of annotations grouped by annotator containing the fields described in the namespace scripts/cue_point.json: it must be acknowledged that the locations of cue points in a track are subjective and ambiguous; indeed, they depend both on the taste and style of the dj, and on the peculiarities of the track itself. to mitigate the impact of
subjectivity, thus improving the replicability of the annotations, we took two measures: first, annotators were given a list of guidelines to follow when annotating. second, an agreement score can be computed for each position annotated. due to the large number of points for possible annotations, we decided to constrain cue in annotations to the intro of the song only (see guideline 4). in the same manner, the cue out annotations are excluded from the intro of the track (see guideline 5). this enables us to limit the time of the annotation process while keeping what we believe are the most valuable and commonly used cue points. we argue that this limitation could, and should be addressed
when using this dataset for an evaluation by artificially limiting the assessment to the portions of the track
covered by the annotations. for each annotation, based on the agreement among the annotators, a score can be computed as the ratio of the people annotating this position and the number of annotators for the track. we believe that this score can then be used to remove annotations that did not find a high agreement between annotators. to make the score meaningful, the dataset was independently annotated by five different musicians with a level of qualification ranging from computer-music scientist to semi-professional dj, and we paid attention that each track was annotated by three people. the score is not explicitly computed in this dataset to not enforce a specific implementation. we recommend using a tolerance window of 0.5s to merge annotations from multiple annotators. because the tracks annotated are copyrighted, the audio content cannot be distributed. however, we provide some metadata: note: to convert the annotation times to the alternative audio's space, apply the formula:

512,the nes music database,"the nintendo entertainment system music database (nes-mdb) is a dataset intended for building automatic music composition systems for the nes audio synthesizer (paper). the nes synthesizer has highly constrained compositional parameters which are well-suited to a wide variety of current machine learning techniques. the synthesizer is typically programmed in assembly, but we parse the assembly into straightforward formats that are more suitable for machine learning. this repository contains dataset information as well as nesmdb, a python package that can be used to render your generated music through the nes synthesizer. you only need to install the nesmdb package if you want to listen to your generated results. otherwise, you may simply download an appropriate format of the dataset. the nes-mdb dataset consists of 5278 songs from the soundtracks of 397 nes games. the dataset represents 296 unique composers, and the songs contain more than two million notes combined. we build nes-mdb starting from the assembly code of nes games, which contain the exact timings and parameter values necessary for accurate chiptune renditions. we split the dataset into training, validation, and testing splits, ensuring that no composer appears in multiple splits. the nes synthesizer has five instrument voices: two pulse-wave generators (p1, p2), a triangle-wave generator (tr), a percussive noise generator (no), and an audio sample playback channel (excluded for simplicity). each voice is programmed by modifying four 8-bit registers which update the audio synthesis state. with nes-mdb, our goal is to allow researchers to study nes music while shielding them from the inner workings of an archaic audio synthesis chip. hence, we offer the dataset in several convenient formats, and provide details for those who wish to dig deeper. if your background is in algorithmic composition, we recommend using either the midi or score formats. if you are more familiar with language modeling, we recommend the nes language modeling (nlm) format. hover download links for sha256 checksums. the midi file format stores discrete musical events that describe a composition. midi files in nes-mdb consist of note/velocity/timbre events with 44.1 khz timing resolution, allowing for sample-accurate reconstruction by an nes synthesizer. each midi file consists of four instrument voices: p1, p2, tr, and no. each voice contains a timestamped list of midi note events. all voices except for tr contain additional timestamped lists of midi control change events representing velocity (cc11) and timbre (cc12) information. click here for an ipython notebook exploring the midi version of nes-mdb example source code for loading an nes-mdb midi with pretty_midi: the three score formats are piano roll representations. unlike the sparse (event-based) midi format, the score formats are dense and sampled at a fixed rate of 24 hz to make them more compact, and are thus lossy.   depiction and dimensionality of the expressive score format (all values are discrete). the expressive score format contains all of the information that the nes synthesizer needs to render the music at each timestep. each song is represented as an numpy.uint8 array of size nx4x3, where n is the number of timesteps at 24 hz. there are 4 synthesis voices, and each has a state of 3 bytes per timestep consisting of note, velocity and timbral information. the above table displays the possible values for each of the instrument voices. the triangle voice only uses note information and will always take value 0 for velocity and timbre. example source code for loading an nes-mdb expressive score:  depiction of the separated score format the separated score format is the same as the expressive score format except it only contains note information, and thus each song is a numpy.uint8 array of size nx4. this format is convenient if you wish to only model the notes/timing of the music and not expressive performance characteristics.  depiction of the blended score format the blended score format is a degenerate representation where the three melodic voices of the nes synthesizer are flattened into ""chords"". each song is represented as a list-of-lists consisting of all the sounding notes at each timestep: e.g. [[60, 64, 67], [60], [], [62, 69]]. we offer this format for compatibility with four other canonical datasets often studied in polyphonic music composition (boulanger-lewandowski et al. 2012). as this format loses instrument voice information, we do not recommend studying it for the purposes of novel nes music generation. the nes language modeling (nlm) format is a timestamped list of instructions controlling the synthesizer state machine. such a list format has less musical structure than midi or scores as instructions controlling the four instrument voices are entangled. however, it might be possible to train powerful sequential models to learn the semantics of this format. here is an annotated example: in the nlm format, the first line is always a clock instruction which indicates the frequency of the console clock (ntsc games use 1789772 or 1789773 and pal games use 1662607). each subsequent line consists of either function,value, an instruction that updates the synthesis state, or w,samples, an instruction that waits for some number of audio samples (at 44.1 khz) before proceeding. as an example approach, we created a state space of size 50 consisting of an <sos>/<eos> token, the 38 state machine functions, the wait command, and the digits zero through nine. we then trained a character-level lstm language model on this representation and used it to generate new sequences. here are some audio examples (can you do better?) the aforementioned formats are derived from the vgm format. vgm is designed to store timestamped logs of writes to several video game console synthesizers at audio sample rate (44.1 khz). version 1.61 added support for the nes synthesizer (this is the only version nesmdb currently supports). if you would like to develop your own formats or work with the sample playback channel (which we exclude), we also provide the original vgm files aggregated from vgmrips. nesmdb is a python 2 (support for python 3 forthcoming) package which can render your generated music through an emulation of the nes synthesizer. additionally, it can convert between dataset formats or convert new vgm files into the existing formats. to install nesmdb, simply type pip install nesmdb. this script will download, compile, and install vgmplay to render nes audio. currently only tested on ubuntu 16.04 lts; please open an issue if build fails. use the following code to convert an song to a wav depending on your dataset format. in all cases, the result will be a one-dimensional numpy array containing the audio samples in floating point at 44.1khz. use the following commands to convert a batch of files to wavs from the command line. if you're converting a single file, you can remove the --out_dir argument todo todo the nes synthesizer has five instrument voices: two pulse-wave generators (p1, p2), a triangle-wave generator (tr), a percussive noise generator (no), and an audio sample playback channel (excluded for simplicity). each voice is programmed by modifying four 8-bit registers which update the audio synthesis state. some of these registers control multiple internal synthesis parameters; a single write to a register may be a partial update of a single parameter or a full change of all parameters. for example, the second register of the pulse generator controls the enabling (1 bit), period (3 bits), negation (1 bit) and shift factor (3 bits) of the frequency sweeper. the nlm format expands register writes into constituent function updates, removing functions that do not change from their last value. hence, certain functions will always appear together in a fixed sequence when the source is a real vgm file. however, when converting from nlm back to vgm, we handle function updates gracefully, so that proper syntax need not be enforced by algorithmic generation methods. below is a high-level description of the 38 functions in the nlm format. this is far from a complete picture of the full nes synthesizer state machine. for more information, see this guide. if you use this

645,the kirby collection,"the kirby collection is a unique and irreplaceable pre-urbanization example of the musical heritage of southern africa. this is an internationally recognized collection and is an important research and educational resource, making a key contribution to the knowledge and understanding of musical traditions. the kirby collection is housed on the ground floor of the south african college of music and is currently only available for research to university staff and students. percival kirby was an internationally acclaimed historian and musicologist and is regarded as a pioneer in the field of south african musicology. he arrived in south africa from scotland in 1914. as musical organiser to the natal education department from 1914 to 1921 he became aware that the music of many local communities was disappearing under western influence. in the early 1930s, while professor of music at the university of the witwatersrand, he undertook a comprehensive study of the musical practices of south african people and built up an extensive and valuable collection of musical instruments through field trips and donations. this collection and his research became the basis of his book the musical instruments of the native races of south africa (publisher oxford university press, 1934). this book still remains the standard reference on the subject. the collection comprises more than 600 musical instruments, the majority of which were used in southern africa prior to 1934. it includes instruments made and played by all indigenous southern african groups. it also includes a smaller collection of instruments from western europe and from asia for comparative purposes. the collection was assembled before the rapid increase of urbanization in south africa, but even during the field trips professor kirby undertook in the 1930s to study the musical practices of south african people and to observe how the instruments were played and how they were made, he became very aware that these instruments were becoming obsolete. in the preface to the 2nd edition of his book kirby explained that a typical example of this was the venda mbila. the craftsmen who made the mbila and the musicians who played it had all died and as they were unable to train successors the instrument was no longer being made and is now extinct. on a trip to bechuanaland in 1931 to hear the tswana reed flutes he stated that it took considerable trouble to organize a group of 23 players because performances had to take place out of sight as the missionaries regarded these dances as ""heathen"". in his autobiography wits end (publisher howard timmins, 1967) professor kirby stated that in the future it would no longer be possible to write such a book as the impact of foreign influences had caused many of the instruments to become obsolete. it is these instruments that make up the greatest part of his collection.",http://www.sacm.uct.ac.za/sacm/kirbycollection,0

678,chicago music forever,"with chicago music forever, the reader hopes to capture some of the many histories that have shaped the city’s multifaceted music community. music journalism is often ephemeral, and that’s not a knock on it—the same quality that makes show recommendations useful also means they rarely have long shelf lives, and very few album reviews or artist interviews still feel relevant 20 years later. what would it look like to create music stories with an eye toward future audiences? the reader already does this to some extent, of course. our archives contain a great deal of chicago music history that’s just as informative now as when it was written, and we continue to publish such stories every year. the ten new pieces at the heart of chicago music forever add to the reader’s record of this history, describing not just current events but also developments that span nearly 150 years. one chronicles the development of duranguense in the city’s mexican american community around the turn of the 21st century; another details the catholic school parties on the south and west sides that helped incubate the house-music scene in the 1970s and ’80s; a third describes chicago’s emergence as an epicenter for the manufacture and distribution of musical instruments after the great fire. by filling in gaps and corners and illuminating subterranean connections, this sort of storytelling can make it easier to grasp chicago’s music history as an almost infinitely detailed and constantly evolving tapestry. in defiance of the segregation that blights the city, it demonstrates that no single thread exists apart from the others. aside from these ten pieces, this page contains an evolving selection from the reader archives, which heavily favors material without an expiration date: oral histories, deep dives, memorial tributes, and obituaries. we’ve also included a link to our continuously updated community calendar of upcoming music events.",https://chicagoreader.com/chicago-music-forever/,0

712,burns antiphoner,"this manuscript sanctorale antiphoner, of unknown provenance and ownership history until its purchase by boston college in 1998, was probably copied in the mid 1300s, in southern germany, austria or switzerland. one of the few important and easily readable clues that remain within the manuscript itself is a single rubric that is not in latin, as elsewhere in the manuscript and as would usually be expected, but in german (or perhaps flemish/dutch), suggesting that it was copied by a german-speaking scribe for german-speaking readers. it is a relatively modest volume in its proportions and format, and its several creators took a practical approach in their simple copying and decorative schemes. though no rubric or other metatextual indication identifies the book conclusively with the franciscans (or clarissans), the presence of offices for the founders, francis (franciscus vir catholicus, by julian of speyer, c.1235, revised 1260) and clare (jam sanctae clarae claritas, anonymous contrafactum of julian’s francis office, c.1295, in regular use by c.1340s) and a sequence for francis (caeli cives in colono) together indicate that it was probably made by and for members of the order. an unusual liturgical feature is the inclusion, within the proper, and significantly out of place in the expected calendrical sequence, of the office of corpus christi, sacerdos in aeternum, promulgated in 1264 by urban iv, but perhaps not in wide use before confirmation by clement v at the council of vienne in 1311-12. the single most interesting musical feature of this otherwise completely monophonic manuscript is the inclusion of a short passage of written 2-voice polyphony at the opening of the sequence caeli solem imitantes. also distinctive liturgically and musically are the rarely encountered magnificat antiphon at first vespers of clare, o decus et gaudium (a contrafactum of the francis antiphon o stupor et gaudium) and, in the sequence for francis, caeli cives in colono, a previously unreported extra double verse, jam depulsa carnis mole. in other respects, the contents of this interesting but otherwise rather unassuming manuscript largely concord with earlier (1200s) and contemporary (1300s) franciscan office books indexed in cantus.",https://burnsantiphoner.bc.edu/,0

779,the dancehall archive & research initiative,"with its seeds rooted in the early toast and talk over style credited to the first wave of jamaican deejays of the 1950s, jamaica’s dancehall has exploded outwards from its confined beginnings inside of kingston’s inner-cities to become a global art form and a space of artistic and creative expression for more than three generations of youths from multiple backgrounds and cultures.  spanning more than five decades and covering several generations from its early forms to the present, dancehall is the clear antecedent to music and cultural forms such as rap music (hip hop) in the usa, reggaeton (more appropriately dancehallton) in latin/south america, and seeded others like afrobeat on the african continent and tropical house in the americas.  as the decades advance, the need to appropriately position dancehall in the global and international musical and cultural debates becomes more pressing. the dancehall archive and research initiative (“dha”) is the brainchild of professor donna p. hope and was conceptualised during her more than three and a half decades of participation in, and research and scholarship about, dancehall.  its mission is to preserve and disseminate the knowledge and culture of dancehall for current and future generations across the world by facilitating and encouraging the pursuit of research and scholarship, art, culture around dancehall culture. the dha is committed to unearthing and documenting all forms of  scholarship on dancehall and developing, maintaining and supporting intellectually challenging, creative and  innovative research and scholarship from all fields that simultaneously highlight and preserve the stellar achievements of dancehall as a global art form that resonates with individuals from multiple cultures, races and socioeconomic backgrounds. the dha’s website – dancehallarchive.org – and its interconnected social media platforms, will provide information about seminal and ongoing dancehall works, as well as about our activities and projects, while acting as a resource for all who seek to know about, develop, build, preserve, and represent for dancehall culture globally.",http://www.dancehallarchive.org/,0

781,vernacular wax cylinder recordings at the ucsb library,"the ucsb library’s department of special collections houses more than 650 vernacular wax cylinder recordings, or home wax recordings, from the 1890s through the 1920s that capture the early spirit of the public’s interaction with recording technology. in march 2015 the collection was added to the 2014 national recording registry at the library of congress and may be the world’s largest and most diverse collection of early vernacular sound recordings. the bulk of the collection is from the david giovannoni collection of home cylinder recordings at the university of california santa barbara. it offers a unique opportunity to time-travel through sound—to eavesdrop on the private lives of our forebears. we hope that making the collection available online for all to hear will lead to a new appreciation and understanding of this rich but overlooked part of our heritage of historic recorded sound. the home recordings found in this collection weren’t always literally made in people’s homes. instead, they’re the audio equivalent of what richard chalfen calls the “home-mode of visual communication”1—which is to say, they involve the use of media for intimate, private, and personal purposes rather than public, impersonal ones. they can be distinguished both from commercial recordings made by the recording industry for popular exhibition and sale and from field recordings made by collectors for institutional preservation and academic study. for many years, home recordings weren’t valued as highly as commercial or field recordings. even today, some phonograph enthusiasts are all-too-ready to shave home-recorded cylinders from a century or more ago to reuse the blanks for making new recordings. to some extent, then, this represents a longterm, concerted rescue operation. its nucleus was assembled in the 1970s and 1980s by don hill, one of the first people to recognize the value of home recordings as anthropological artifacts. david giovannoni acquired hill’s collection in the mid-1990s and added steadily to it up until the time of its acquisition by uscb in 2013. home, commercial, and field recordings can all feature vernacular performance traditions, oral histories, and the like, but commercial and field recordings have generally been initiated by outsiders for their own purposes and shaped with those purposes in mind. the recording industry has aimed to capture material that will sell, while fieldworkers have sought to document specific kinds of material that are of academic or artistic interest to them. by contrast, home recordings are made by and among groups of family and friends for their own use and enjoyment. the act of recording doesn’t intrude on the vernacular performance context as it does in the other cases, but instead heightens and extends it. we get to hear what ordinary people chose to record, and how they chose to adapt it to the medium, when they were in charge of the equipment and weren’t being told what to do by someone else.",https://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/homewax.php,0
782,timeline of african american music,"the timeline of african american music represents decades of scholarship conducted and led by dr. portia k. maultsby, a pioneer in the study of african american music, as well as the contributions of numerous scholars. from the earliest folk traditions to present-day popular music, the timeline is a detailed view of the evolution of african american musical genres that span the past 400 years. this celebration of african american musical traditions reveals the unique characteristics of each genre and style, while also offering in-depth studies of pioneering musicians who created some of america’s most timeless artistic expressions. in 2009, soprano jessye norman brought dr. maultsby and her work to carnegie hall as part of the festival honor! a celebration of the african american cultural legacy. as a cornerstone of the festival, miss norman wanted educational initiatives to expand the audience’s journey of discovery, including the first interactive version of the timeline. after the festival, the timeline became an integral part of carnegie hall’s online educational resources and continued to serve music lovers, educators, and students around the world for more than a decade. through generous support from the neh and nea, and in collaboration with synoptic office, the timeline has been reimagined and updated to serve a new generation of audiences. visitors to the timeline can expand their knowledge through multimedia stories, recordings of legendary musicians, and rarely seen historical images from carnegie hall’s rose archives. closely connected to carnegie hall, this interactive presentation of the timeline examines seminal african american musical, cultural, and political events that have taken place at the hall throughout the past 130 years. the timeline is a superb historical study and a celebration of living musical traditions for all to explore.",https://timeline.carnegiehall.org/timeline,0

784,strachwitz frontera collection of mexican and mexican american recordings,"the arhoolie foundation's strachwitz frontera collection of mexican and mexican american recordings is the largest repository of these commercially produced vernacular recordings in existence. the nearly 160,000 recordings in the collection were made primarily in the united states and mexico and were issued on 78 rpm, 45 rpm, and 33⅓ rpm (long-playing, or lp) phonograph records and cassette and reel-to-reel tapes. the earliest recording was made in 1908, and the latest recordings were released in the 1990s. these performances are divided into three sections, roughly by era. because of the depth and breadth of each section, and because many of the recordings are irreplaceable, the strachwitz frontera collection is unique. the early-twentieth-century section includes approximately 35,000 individual songs recorded on 17,000 two-sided 78 rpm discs. these rare and very fragile records were released between 1905 and 1955. many types of popular songs are represented in the performances, which include the first recordings of corridos (narrative ballads on topics of the day), canciones, boleros, rancheras, and sones. this section also contains many types of instrumental music, including the first recordings of norteño and conjunto music. the artists who made these records helped propagate and popularize a number of traditional regional styles, such as the tejano music of south texas, providing the foundation for latino music today. in addition, this section includes spoken performances such as patriotic speeches and comedy skits. many of the recordings are one of a kind because the companies that made them no longer exist or, if the companies do exist, the masters were lost or destroyed. the late-twentieth-century section contains approximately 56,000 individual songs from 45 rpm recordings that date from around 1955 to the 1990s. these include recordings produced by a wide range of small regional firms that were created to serve the musical interests of the growing immigrant population in the united states, especially along the u.s.-mexico border. the last section of the collection includes over 62,000 individual songs from 33⅓ rpm phonograph records and cassette tapes also from 1955 to 1990. these songs demonstrate the continuity of traditional styles into contemporary times. also in the collection are rare reel-to-reel master tapes whose recording dates span the end of the 78 rpm era through the lp era.",https://frontera.library.ucla.edu/,0
