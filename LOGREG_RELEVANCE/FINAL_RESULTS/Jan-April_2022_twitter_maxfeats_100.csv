The different ways in which it is being defined and what side of it is brought to the fore depend strongly on scholar's perspective and intention .  Mainstream popular music does not refer to a coherent musical category in the form of, for example, a defined genre characterised by distinct formal, technical, semiotic, social or other ‘rules’ Mainstream music is music that is discredited as being ‘banal, homogeneous, unsophisticated, uncultured, low, inauthentic, fake, commercial, conservative, conformist or just plain stupid’  Mainstream popular music is a praxis formation of producing and perceiving music that incorporates specific ways of collective thinking and action as well as underlying logics . It is a specific ‘discursive framework’ in Lee Marshall's terms, giving listeners ‘the tools to make sense of the sounds they hear’  Mainstream popular music often carries image of being polished, pre-processed, cut-and-dried, overproduced and removed of any edge whatsoever . Such attributions relate more strongly to how the songs were produced than to their inherent aesthetic qualities .  Music takes function of a more general cultural evaluation surface on which society negotiates its dominant conceptions, narratives and ideologies . Mainstream popular music can be analysed as a society's loudest but most provisional stage on which to perform or contest normativity .  The section starts with a relatively lengthy, critical reflection of quantitative big data examinations and continues with a discussion of music-theoretical perspectives . The second section emphasises research in which the audiences of post-2000 mainstream popular music is the focus (listener-based analysis)  According to Schellenberg and von Scheve's findings, there was an increasing emergence of minor mode and slower tempos during the 1965–2009 period on Billboard's Top 40 charts . Successful songs seem to defy this downward trend in mood, as they display a tendency to be happier, more party-like and danceable, less sad, more feminine and possess a brighter timbre than songs that fail to enter the charts .  Big data analyses do little to support our knowledge of why certain trends and transitions have happened and how they connected to broader contexts . The global 2017 hit ‘Despacito’ is not necessarily a sad song, nor is LMFAO's ‘Party Rock Anthem’ (2011)  The scope of popular music analysis has expanded beyond its traditional focus, which used to be primarily the sounds of (classic and progressive) rock music and the Beatles . 21st century commercial pop music is still little represented as a research subject in this field . In-depth research on the correlation between certain musical dimensions in actual songs and listeners’ movements remains in its early stages .  New song forms in the ‘current pop mainstream’ featuring single-loop repetitions, post-choruses and ‘pop drops’ are shown in an ongoing corpus analysis project that examines the Billboard Year End Top 10 from 2006 to 2016 . Authors take hit songs from the 21st century as examples to discuss new analytical conceptualisations regarding particular features of popular music .  A lack of production-based theoretical analysis that considers in detail ‘the technical aspects of a song's production’ is certainly an issue in popular music analysis in general . Robin Attas remarks that to study phrase rhythm in such mainstream artists as Sarah McLachlan is to miss the truly interesting manipulations of phrase and phrase rhythm that exist in pop music .  21st century hit-records’ music often is given only short shrift in recent publications on sound and recording issues in popular culture . For example, Immanuel Brockhaus analyses prototypical, ‘iconic’ sounds in music from the Billboard charts (1966–2014) in his book Kultsounds .  There seems to be more interest in how mainstream popular music's sounds are made on the edge of academic and journalistic work . An extensive source for hit-songs’ analysis is the platform songlexikon. de, which is published by the University of Freiburg .  There has been a rising awareness in popular music analysis of the reflection of the analyst's subjectivity in hearing, experiencing and interpreting music . Popular music musicologists are usually not among those who make mainstream popular music an essential part of their cultural practices and aesthetic experiences .  Mainstream popular music analysis and music-oriented emotion studies generally turn out to be a rather bad match . Recent studies concerned with a vast amount of songs from the UK or US charts in connection with notions of emotion and mood are rarely or not at all in the studies on music and emotion .  Emery Schubert: 'There exists a general aversion to the study of emotion in pop music from the listener's perspective' Herbert and Dibben show that 10- to 18-year-old listeners are likely to claim ownership of a ‘four-chord pop’ song like Kelly Clarkson's 2004 hit ‘Behind These Hazel Eyes’, as they link extracts of it to personal everyday functions .  The different approaches that I have outlined in this article reveal – or potentially might reveal – various facets of 21st century mainstream popular music's sounds from diverse perspectives . However, owing to these (and other) approaches’ diversity, the research field presents itself as quite fragmented .  The duality of presentation and production is a pivotal aspect in examining this formation's characteristics, requiring a cross-disciplinary, praxeological approach . Context-sensitive music analysis equipped with an extended repertoire of music-theoretical concepts is, essentially, the key method for examining the role of the sounds within the actions and logics of the mainstream popular music frame .",new,false positive
