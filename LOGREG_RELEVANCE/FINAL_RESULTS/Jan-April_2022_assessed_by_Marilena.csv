 Some thoughts here: https://t.co/0DwA9CjSSI
 

 TheFall https://t.co/0AbvvmUTqx","Imperial Wax Solvent' is an album that has many brilliant songs scattered throughout its forty seven minutes . Mark E. Smith and keyboard player/vocalist/wife Eleni Poulou returned to the studio, joined by British musicians Dave Spurr, Kieron M ‘Imperial Wax Solvent’ is incredibly rewarding, even if some of the remaining material can seem little less appealing . It’s as different from most peoples’ pre-conceived idea of The Fall as ‘Telephone Thing’ surely had been 'IWS' is a solid album padded out with three or four tracks that it never really needed . Although enjoyable, it fails to reach the top tier of material simply because the half a dozen best tracks are so much better . ‘Ponto’ is a brilliantly disjointed affair that borrows the opening chords from ‘Jailhouse Rock’ and melds them to jagged new wave bleeps and more of a staccato rhythm . ‘Inferior Product Man A fifteen song tour de force, the set draws very heavily from then-recent material . Eleven of the songs taken from the three most recent albums . Sound quality isn't superb but it's better than a good few of the official bootlegs issued by Cog Sinister over If you liked ‘Imperial Wax Before’, you’ll definitely want this…and if you felt a little indifferent to the single album, this definitely makes it worth a revisit .

 https://t.co/kV1RE0kbg7","The concept of the mainstream has often only been used to demarcate, rather vaguely, the binary other to the authentic, honest, subversive, and creative . The different ways in which it is being defined and what side of it is brought to the fore depend strongly on the particular Mainstream popular music does not refer to a coherent musical category in the form of, for example, a defined genre characterised by distinct formal, technical, semiotic, social or other ‘rules’ Mainstream music is music that is discredited as being ‘banal Mainstream popular music is a praxis formation of producing and perceiving music that incorporates specific ways of collective thinking and action as well as underlying logics . It is a specific ‘discursive framework’ in Lee Marshall's terms, giving listeners ‘the tools to Mainstream popular music often carries image of being polished, pre-processed, cut-and-dried, overproduced and removed of any edge whatsoever . Such attributions relate more strongly to how the songs were produced than to their inherent aesthetic qualities . Music takes function of a more general cultural evaluation surface on which society negotiates its dominant conceptions, narratives and ideologies . Mainstream popular music can be analysed as a society's loudest but most provisional stage on which to perform or contest normativity . The section starts with a relatively lengthy, critical reflection of quantitative big data examinations and continues with a discussion of music-theoretical perspectives . The second section emphasises research in which the audiences of post-2000 mainstream popular music is the focus (listener-based analysis) According to Schellenberg and von Scheve's findings, there was an increasing emergence of minor mode and slower tempos during the 1965–2009 period on Billboard's Top 40 charts . Successful songs seem to defy this downward trend in mood, as they display a tendency to be Big data analyses do little to support our knowledge of why certain trends and transitions have happened and how they connected to broader contexts . The global 2017 hit ‘Despacito’ is not necessarily a sad song, nor is LMFAO's ‘Party Rock Anthem’ The scope of popular music analysis has expanded beyond its traditional focus, which used to be primarily the sounds of (classic and progressive) rock music and the Beatles . 21st century commercial pop music is still little represented as a research subject in this field . New song forms in the ‘current pop mainstream’ featuring single-loop repetitions, post-choruses and ‘pop drops’ are shown in an ongoing corpus analysis project that examines the Billboard Year End Top 10 from 2006 to 2016 . A lack of production-based theoretical analysis that considers in detail ‘the technical aspects of a song's production’ is certainly an issue in popular music analysis in general . Robin Attas remarks that to study phrase rhythm in such mainstream artists as Sarah McLachlan is to miss 21st century hit-records’ music often is given only short shrift in recent publications on sound and recording issues in popular culture . For example, Immanuel Brockhaus analyses prototypical, ‘iconic’ sounds in music from the Billboard charts (1966– There seems to be more interest in how mainstream popular music's sounds are made on the edge of academic and journalistic work . An extensive source for hit-songs’ analysis is the platform songlexikon. de, which is published by the University of Freiburg . There has been a rising awareness in popular music analysis of the reflection of the analyst's subjectivity in hearing, experiencing and interpreting music . Popular music musicologists are usually not among those who make mainstream popular music an essential part of their cultural practices and aesthetic experiences . Mainstream popular music analysis and music-oriented emotion studies generally turn out to be a rather bad match . Recent studies concerned with a vast amount of songs from the UK or US charts in connection with notions of emotion and mood are rarely or not at all in the studies on music and Emery Schubert: 'There exists a general aversion to the study of emotion in pop music from the listener's perspective' Herbert and Dibben show that 10- to 18-year-old listeners are likely to claim ownership of a ‘four-chord pop The different approaches that I have outlined in this article reveal – or potentially might reveal – various facets of 21st century mainstream popular music's sounds from diverse perspectives . However, owing to these (and other) approaches’ diversity, the research field presents itself as quite fragmented . The duality of presentation and production is a pivotal aspect in examining this formation's characteristics, requiring a cross-disciplinary, praxeological approach that integrates both production- and reception-oriented methods .

 https://t.co/gwq0KBInEA https://t.co/cpOGG8AKPV","The full-length compositional debut of Christopher Otto, violinist and founding member of the internationally acclaimed JACK Quartet . With its exacting mathematical construction, a harmonic language bridging just intonation and triadic tonality, and a dazzling, immersive sound, rag'sma JI treats these pure, rational intervals as its musical building blocks, rather than the twelve notes of the traditional Western chromatic scale . Unlike irrational, equal-tempered intervals, these rational intervals create cycles that align periodically, which gives the intervals a feeling of stability and distinctiveness Composer Christopher Otto has long been fascinated with just intonation . Rag′sma is a sprawling work that emphasizes the hypnotic effect of drone in its slowly expanding tones . Composer Austin Wulliman, violist John Pickford Richards, and cellist Jay Campbell share 'rag'sma' embodies the best of academic and mystical revelation with first-class production underpinning it . Fans of microtonal, dissonant, and unstable tunings will find a brand new universe to drown in . The package follows in the gorgeously high production standard as Christopher Otto is a composer and violinist living in the Bronx, New York .
