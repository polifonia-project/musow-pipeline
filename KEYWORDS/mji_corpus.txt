the touchstone of the dram collection is the diverse catalogue of american music represented by the new world records and cri label(s), which merged in 2007. from folk to opera, native american to jazz, 19th century classical to early rock, musical theater, contemporary, electronic and beyond, new world has served composers, artists, students and the general public since its inception in 1975 with a grant from the rockefeller foundation. 

the acquisition of cri deepened its catalog of contemporary american composition and restored to circulation recordings that had, in some cases, been out of print for decades. dram also includes music from a growing number of recording labels and archives. more than 4,000 albums' worth of recordings from a distinctive set of 42 independent labels and archives are now available, with new content being continuously added.

the projects manifested in 2015 from the under/misrepresentation and historical erasure of latinx communities in southern california. these community-generated projects begin with an open invitation to various latino communities to share personal images and memories that create visual narratives that celebrate identities and historicize subcultures. the archives explore ideas about how history and culture are framed and who does the framing.  

guadalupe’s studio also houses and preserves a physical archive of chicano/latino ephemera from the 1970s to the late-1990s, including but not limited to magazines, prison art and letters, posters and flyers from the los angeles underground backyard-party and rave scenes of the 1990s.

doyle is also behind houston lgbt history, a website that began as a section of queer music heritage that has grown outside music into other aspects of lgbt focused politics and culture in houston, texas. houston lgbt history also features a huge number of national and regional publications regarding lgbt culture, like this week in texas and a chronological directory of early national gay publications, reaching back over 50 years. all of these publications can be downloaded from the website.

alongside a full pdf archive of all 30 issues of hot wire, the website also features directories of links to women’s music and other women’s culture archives. hot wire has also published special newsletters of updates on what “longtime friends” of the publication have been doing since it ceased operation.

this site currently contains approximately 13,000 audio samples and associated metadata from 5 music collections alongside additional projects covering folk music from across the african continent alongside found sounds and modern music.

the touchstone of the dram collection is the diverse catalogue of american music represented by the new world records and cri label(s), which merged in 2007. from folk to opera, native american to jazz, 19th century classical to early rock, musical theater, contemporary, electronic and beyond, new world has served composers, artists, students and the general public since its inception in 1975 with a grant from the rockefeller foundation. 

the acquisition of cri deepened its catalog of contemporary american composition and restored to circulation recordings that had, in some cases, been out of print for decades. dram also includes music from a growing number of recording labels and archives. more than 4,000 albums' worth of recordings from a distinctive set of 42 independent labels and archives are now available, with new content being continuously added.

the online archive includes a selection of full and partial interviews and images from the research.

the projects manifested in 2015 from the under/misrepresentation and historical erasure of latinx communities in southern california. these community-generated projects begin with an open invitation to various latino communities to share personal images and memories that create visual narratives that celebrate identities and historicize subcultures. the archives explore ideas about how history and culture are framed and who does the framing.  

guadalupe’s studio also houses and preserves a physical archive of chicano/latino ephemera from the 1970s to the late-1990s, including but not limited to magazines, prison art and letters, posters and flyers from the los angeles underground backyard-party and rave scenes of the 1990s.

doyle is also behind houston lgbt history, a website that began as a section of queer music heritage that has grown outside music into other aspects of lgbt focused politics and culture in houston, texas. houston lgbt history also features a huge number of national and regional publications regarding lgbt culture, like this week in texas and a chronological directory of early national gay publications, reaching back over 50 years. all of these publications can be downloaded from the website.

alongside a full pdf archive of all 30 issues of hot wire, the website also features directories of links to women’s music and other women’s culture archives. hot wire has also published special newsletters of updates on what “longtime friends” of the publication have been doing since it ceased operation.

this site currently contains approximately 13,000 audio samples and associated metadata from 5 music collections alongside additional projects covering folk music from across the african continent alongside found sounds and modern music.
