Folkstreams,"The films on Folkstreams were produced by independent filmmakers. These documentaries focus on the culture, struggles, and arts of unnoticed Americans from many different kinds of communities. The filmmakers were driven more by sheer engagement with the people and their traditions than by commercial hopes. Their films have unusual subjects, odd lengths, and talkers who do not speak ""broadcast English."" Although the films won prizes at festivals, were used in college classes, and occasionally were shown on PBS, they found few outlets in video shops, commercial theaters, or television. But they have permanent value. They come from the same intellectual movements that gave rise to American studies, regional and ethnic studies, the ""new history,"" ""performance theory,"" and investigations of tenacious cultural styles in phenomena like song, dance, storytelling, visual arts, worship, and ceremonies. They also respond to the intense political and social ferment of the last century and this one. Many of the films are linked to significant published research. Folkstreams draws on this material to accompany and illuminate both the subjects and the filmmaking. And the films themselves add powerful dimensions to print scholarship. They offer direct experience of unfamiliar worlds. Many of these worlds are now receding into the historical past. The mission of Folkstreams is to preserve these films and their records of these worlds and make them available to the widest possible audience.",https://www.folkstreams.net/
The Kirby Collection,"The Kirby Collection is a unique and irreplaceable pre-urbanization example of the musical heritage of Southern Africa. This is an internationally recognized collection and is an important research and educational resource, making a key contribution to the knowledge and understanding of musical traditions. The Kirby Collection is housed on the ground floor of the South African College of Music and is currently only available for research to University staff and students. Percival Kirby was an internationally acclaimed historian and musicologist and is regarded as a pioneer in the field of South African musicology. He arrived in South Africa from Scotland in 1914. As Musical Organiser to the Natal Education Department from 1914 to 1921 he became aware that the music of many local communities was disappearing under western influence. In the early 1930s, while Professor of Music at the University of the Witwatersrand, he undertook a comprehensive study of the musical practices of South African people and built up an extensive and valuable collection of musical instruments through field trips and donations. This collection and his research became the basis of his book The Musical Instruments of the Native Races of South Africa (publisher Oxford University Press, 1934). This book still remains the standard reference on the subject. The Collection comprises more than 600 musical instruments, the majority of which were used in Southern Africa prior to 1934. It includes instruments made and played by all indigenous Southern African groups. It also includes a smaller collection of instruments from Western Europe and from Asia for comparative purposes. The Collection was assembled before the rapid increase of urbanization in South Africa, but even during the field trips Professor Kirby undertook in the 1930s to study the musical practices of South African people and to observe how the instruments were played and how they were made, he became very aware that these instruments were becoming obsolete. In the preface to the 2nd edition of his book Kirby explained that a typical example of this was the Venda mbila. The craftsmen who made the mbila and the musicians who played it had all died and as they were unable to train successors the instrument was no longer being made and is now extinct. On a trip to Bechuanaland in 1931 to hear the Tswana reed flutes he stated that it took considerable trouble to organize a group of 23 players because performances had to take place out of sight as the missionaries regarded these dances as ""heathen"". In his autobiography Wits End (publisher Howard Timmins, 1967) Professor Kirby stated that in the future it would no longer be possible to write such a book as the impact of foreign influences had caused many of the instruments to become obsolete. It is these instruments that make up the greatest part of his collection.",http://www.sacm.uct.ac.za/sacm/kirbycollection

Phonogrammarchiv,"The Phonogrammarchiv was founded in 1899. Its key tasks are to generate, collect and catalogue audio-visual research recordings from all disciplines and regions, to preserve them in the long term, and to make them permanently available. In archiving, the Phonogrammarchiv pays particular attention to the source-critical annotation of the recorded materials, as this provides the added value ensuring the possibility of multi-faceted modes of analysis. The Phonogrammarchiv has built up, and expands, its holdings through field research projects that have received its methodological and technical support, through fieldwork conducted by its staff, and by taking over collections assembled by Austrian scholars, typically all exploring new ground. Likewise, the Phonogrammarchiv has always been engaged in methodological and technical developments pertaining to the making, replaying, and storing of audio and video recordings, which also led to today’s expertise in making playable, transferring and digitizing historical sound carriers. Access to the Phonogrammarchiv’s collections is also promoted by publications and specific editions of recordings (e.g. TheComplete Historical Collections 1899–1950). The Phonogrammarchiv is therefore characterized by its interlocking fields of activity, which fact is reflected also by the interdisciplinary composition of its team (African studies, history, ethnomusicology, cultural and social anthropology, linguistics, AV technology, IT). In accordance with its agenda, the Phonogrammarchiv is thus a research institute anchored in the scholarly world as well as an archive serving general societal interests that greatly contributes to the documentation and preservation of cultural heritage.",https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/phonogrammarchiv/phonogrammarchiv/mission-statement

We support folk and traditional artists, community cultural experts, community-based cultural organizations, and academic and public sector folklorists.

Early members included students of founders Harold Thompson and Louis Jones, as well as folklore scholars and enthusiasts, several of whom were also involved in progressive education experiments and early civil rights activism. The Society began publishing its journal in 1945. The journal, first named New York Folklore Quarterly, was later titled New York Folklore (1977).

Free Music Archive,"Free Music Archive (FMA), founded in 2009 by radio station WFMU, offers free access to open licensed, original music. Historically, radio has always offered the public free access to new music. So with the help of curators, netlabels and thousands of independent musicians around the world FMA became a continuation of that purpose. Tens of millions of visitors every month download music for personal use and many share and remix music from FMA in videos, podcasts, films, games, apps and even school projects. Every MP3 you discover on Free Music Archive is pre-cleared for certain types of uses that would otherwise be prohibited by copyright laws that were not designed for the digital era. These uses vary and are determined by the rights-holders themselves (please see our FAQ) who feel that allowing a degree of free cultural access is beneficial not only to their own pursuits, but to our society as a whole. Free Music Archive is a resource for audiophiles of all stripes, and unlike other websites, all of the audio has been hand-picked by one of our established audio curators. Free Music Archive is a platform for collaboration between curators and artists, including radio stations, netlabels, venues, artist collectives, museums, music festivals and more. The platform combines the curatorial approach that these organizations have played for the last few decades, with the community-generated approach of many current online music sites. Inspired by Creative Commons and the open-source software movement, FMA provides a legal and technological framework for curators, artists, and listeners to harness the potential of music sharing. Every artist page will have a bio and links to the artists’ home page for users to learn more about the music they discover via Free Music Archive. We also seek to compensate artists directly where possible. Artist, album and song profiles may contain links to buy the full album from the artist and/or label’s preferred vendor(s). Users can also “tip” an artist if they like what they hear, sending a donation directly to the artists’ PayPal account. FMA is also experimenting with ""web monetization"" tools. While Free Music Archive is free and open to anyone regardless of registration or other requirements, written and audio content is curated, and permission to upload/edit content is granted on an invitation basis.",https://freemusicarchive.org/home

Chicago Music Forever,"With Chicago Music Forever, the Reader hopes to capture some of the many histories that have shaped the city’s multifaceted music community. Music journalism is often ephemeral, and that’s not a knock on it—the same quality that makes show recommendations useful also means they rarely have long shelf lives, and very few album reviews or artist interviews still feel relevant 20 years later. What would it look like to create music stories with an eye toward future audiences? The Reader already does this to some extent, of course. Our archives contain a great deal of Chicago music history that’s just as informative now as when it was written, and we continue to publish such stories every year. The ten new pieces at the heart of Chicago Music Forever add to the Reader’s record of this history, describing not just current events but also developments that span nearly 150 years. One chronicles the development of duranguense in the city’s Mexican American community around the turn of the 21st century; another details the Catholic school parties on the south and west sides that helped incubate the house-music scene in the 1970s and ’80s; a third describes Chicago’s emergence as an epicenter for the manufacture and distribution of musical instruments after the Great Fire. By filling in gaps and corners and illuminating subterranean connections, this sort of storytelling can make it easier to grasp Chicago’s music history as an almost infinitely detailed and constantly evolving tapestry. In defiance of the segregation that blights the city, it demonstrates that no single thread exists apart from the others. Aside from these ten pieces, this page contains an evolving selection from the Reader archives, which heavily favors material without an expiration date: oral histories, deep dives, memorial tributes, and obituaries. We’ve also included a link to our continuously updated community calendar of upcoming music events.",https://chicagoreader.com/chicago-music-forever/

Le Collezioni di Casa Ricordi,"From its founding in 1808 until the early 20th century, Ricordi influence and reputation were closely tied to the dynamic personalities of the four men who succeeded, from father to son, at its helm: Giovanni (1785-1853), Tito I (1811-1888), Giulio (1840-1912), and Tito II (1865-1933).

Studs Terkel Radio Archive,"The Studs Terkel Radio Archive (STRA), launched in May 2018 on Studs Terkel’s 106th birthday, is a digital platform whereon, eventually, will live the majority of the 5,600 radio programs Terkel created during his career at WFMT in Chicago between 1952 and 1997 live. This platform, augmented by curatorial commentary, re-use tools, educational resources, highlights of creative re-use, and an original podcast, along with other special features, opens up Terkel’s radio programs and allows for a deeper level of user engagement. The Chicago History Museum (CHM) owns Studs Terkel’s archival tapes.  The radio archive is jointly managed by CHM and the WFMT Radio Network, a division of Window to the World Communication Inc. CHM has owned Terkel’s tapes since he retired from WFMT and became a staff member of CHM in 1997. A preliminary online archive of some of Terkel’s audio was created in 2002 and named Studs Terkel: Conversations with America. In 2009, the Library of Congress’s Division of Recorded Sound asked CHM to lend the tapes of the original programs. Soon, the monumental task of digitizing the tapes began, at their state of the art Packard Campus of the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Culpepper, Virginia. Without this support and the expert dedication of the Library of Congress staff, contributed at no charge to CHM, there would be no radio archive. Senator Dick Durbin gets particular credit for helping this project remain a top national priority for the Library of Congress. In 2013, CHM’s President, Gary T. Johnson, approached the staff of the WFMT Radio Network about forming a partnership to make the radio archive accessible to the world. An exploratory committee, consisting of a number of Terkel’s former colleagues and friends as well as experts from related fields, was established to develop a strategic plan for the radio archive as the digitized recordings became available. A planning grant was provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2014, followed by a larger implementation grant in 2016 both of which, along with support from numerous individuals and foundations, enabled work to proceed on developing the digital platform, studsterkel.org, and related programs and projects. STRA will continue to evolve, guided by the staffs at the WFMT Radio Network, the Chicago History Museum, and the Studs Terkel Radio Archive Advisory Committee, which meets regularly to shape the mission and future of the archive. Key partnerships with technology organizations including Digital ReLab and Hyperaudio, education organizations like the Chicago Public Library’s YOUMedia and Great Books Foundation, and a wide variety of media, humanities, and arts organizations have helped expand the archive’s reach.",https://studsterkel.wfmt.com

Contextual Dissemination,"The sole purpose of this website is to make underground, out-of-print, punk zines accessible to anyone doing research.

Contextual Dissemination does not sell content provided on the site, it is completely free to access. This is an open library, so feel free to explore, research and enjoy this resource.

In the case of fanzines such as xXx, T.V.O.R, We Got Power, and Slash, they have had proper books released with the content and we will always encourage people to support the authors by purchasing the books. Links will be provided to websites of fanzine publishers who have their archive online. Content, we are an archive, not gatekeepers of information. We do not edit content out of zines because of publisher’s beliefs, politics, ideas, or thoughts.

Mayrent Institute for Yiddish Culture,"Since its founding in 2010, the Mayrent Institute for Yiddish Culture has approached the project of supporting Yiddish culture at UW–Madison in three ways.

Sounding Spirit Digital Library,"This Sounding Spirit pilot digital library features songbooks and hymnals published across the southern United States from 1850 to 1925. Spanning holdings from four partner archives, the digital library’s twenty-two books include words-only hymnals, gospel songbooks, spiritual collections, and shape-note tunebooks, demonstrating the wide variety of form, content, and presentation in southern vernacular sacred publishing. These songbooks employ competing notation systems and vary in musical style from dispersed harmony fuging tunes and plain tunes of the shape-note repertoire, to antiphonal gospel, to classically inspired arrangements of African American spirituals, to words-only hymns in Muskokee sung in unison, to tunes in oral tradition shared among southern black and white congregations. Organized into collections that highlight texts’ associated places, populations, genres, and denominational affiliations, the digital library allows for rich engagement with songbooks and hymnals seminal in their respective eras, but historically underrepresented in both archival holdings and scholarship. These works and collections illustrate the primacy of songbooks to the dynamic encounters among white, black, and native communities navigating modernizing forces across the US South and beyond. In selecting volumes for the pilot site, Sounding Spirit’s music bibliographer Erin Fulton, project director, Jesse P. Karlsberg, and project manager, Meredith Doster, collaborated with content consultants at each partner archive to balance the diversity of this twenty-two–volume corpus with each collection’s strengths.

Burns Antiphoner,"This manuscript sanctorale antiphoner, of unknown provenance and ownership history until its purchase by Boston College in 1998, was probably copied in the mid 1300s, in southern Germany, Austria or Switzerland. One of the few important and easily readable clues that remain within the manuscript itself is a single rubric that is not in Latin, as elsewhere in the manuscript and as would usually be expected, but in German (or perhaps Flemish/Dutch), suggesting that it was copied by a German-speaking scribe for German-speaking readers. It is a relatively modest volume in its proportions and format, and its several creators took a practical approach in their simple copying and decorative schemes. Though no rubric or other metatextual indication identifies the book conclusively with the Franciscans (or Clarissans), the presence of offices for the founders, Francis (Franciscus vir catholicus, by Julian of Speyer, c.1235, revised 1260) and Clare (Jam sanctae Clarae claritas, anonymous contrafactum of Julian’s Francis office, c.1295, in regular use by c.1340s) and a sequence for Francis (Caeli cives in colono) together indicate that it was probably made by and for members of the order. An unusual liturgical feature is the inclusion, within the proper, and significantly out of place in the expected calendrical sequence, of the office of Corpus Christi, Sacerdos in aeternum, promulgated in 1264 by Urban IV, but perhaps not in wide use before confirmation by Clement V at the Council of Vienne in 1311-12. The single most interesting musical feature of this otherwise completely monophonic manuscript is the inclusion of a short passage of written 2-voice polyphony at the opening of the sequence Caeli solem imitantes. Also distinctive liturgically and musically are the rarely encountered Magnificat antiphon at first vespers of Clare, O decus et gaudium (a contrafactum of the Francis antiphon O stupor et gaudium) and, in the sequence for Francis, Caeli cives in colono, a previously unreported extra double verse, Jam depulsa carnis mole. In other respects, the contents of this interesting but otherwise rather unassuming manuscript largely concord with earlier (1200s) and contemporary (1300s) Franciscan office books indexed in CANTUS.",https://burnsantiphoner.bc.edu/

The full corpus of his creativity—including lyrics, poetry, artwork, and largely unpublished prose writings—encompassed topics such as the environment, love, sex, spirituality, family, and racial justice.

It was approved by the Texas State University System Board of Regents on August 20, 1999. In the fall of 2001 the institute was officially renamed the Center for Texas Music History. The center's primary goal is to help students, scholars, and the general public better understand how Texas music reflects the richly diverse ethnic and cultural heritage of the American Southwest. Through a variety of activities and projects, the center strives to increase awareness and appreciation for the important role music plays in shaping and reflecting the historical development of American society. Headquartered in the university's history department, the center offers graduate and undergraduate courses on the musical history of Texas and the Southwest. Students examine the many different ethnic musical influences involved in the development of the region, including Hispanic, Anglo, African-American, Irish, German, Polish, Czech, French, and others. Students also look at how other social, economic, and political factors have helped shape the region, its people, and its music, as well as how Texas and the Southwest have made important contributions to larger American musical idioms such as blues, ragtime, jazz, conjunto, Tejano, western swing, and rock-and-roll. In 2001 the center began publication of The Journal of Texas Music History, the first academic journal to cover the entire spectrum of Southwestern music history. It worked with the Texas State Historical Association to help produce The Handbook of Texas Music which was first published in 2003 and revised and expanded in 2012. The center sponsors the Texas Music Oral History Program through which it conducts interviews with members of the Texas music community and then archives those interviews for future researchers. Furthermore, the center has worked with a variety of museums, including the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum, as well as public schools and others to organize exhibits, musical performances, and other educational programs. In the early 2000s the center developed the Texas Music History Online web site, which serves as a database for researchers and an interactive classroom teaching tool for educators. Additional events include an annual Texas Music History Unplugged concert, a student songwriter competition, as well as academic panels and other educational activities.

National Archives and Records Service of South Africa,"The National Archives and Records Service of South Africa was established by promulgation of the National Archives and Records Service of South Africa Act (Act No 43 of 1996 as amended). This piece of legislation transformed the former State Archives Service into a National Archives and Records Service whose mission, functions and structures reflect the South African democratic political order and imperatives. In essence, the mission of the National Archives and Records Service is to foster a national identity and the protection of rights By preserving a national archival heritage for use by the government and people of South Africa By promoting efficient, accountable and transparent government through the proper management and care of government records. Records were originally created for a specific purpose as evidence of transactions. By preserving public records created by governmental bodies as archives, the National Archives and Records Service seeks to preserve the memory of what a governmental body, an organization or an individual did, as well as the circumstances and context connected with the activity. Archival records therefore help us to understand who we are, either as individuals or as organizations, and where we come from. By providing us with information about our past, we are better able to understand the present. This information is as important to a nation as individual memory is to each person. Indeed, archives provide a basis for the proper understanding of the past that is important in South Africa to inform the development of a new democratic society. A public archives such as the National Archives and Records Service is therefore a special resource for dealing with the social memory of our nation and with protecting people's rights in our country. It is a major resource for fostering a national identity. It is also a treasure house of national memory resources that is accessible to all. Through its statutory regulation of the management of current government records, the National Archives and Records Service promotes efficient, accountable and transparent evidence-based governance. This is because the information in public records constitutes a strategic resource to enable governmental service delivery. Public records also serve as a major channel for accountability, and are a cornerstone of democracy. Through access to public records and archives, transparency is promoted. By regulating systems of classification of public records in all media and their functional management and disposal, the National Archives and Records Service fosters their effective retrieval, use and preservation for functional and archival purposes. The Act provides for a National Archives Advisory Council to advise the Minister and the Director-General of Arts and Culture on any matter relating to the operation of the Act, and to advise the National Archivist on furthering the objects and functions of the National Archives. The other functions of the National Archives Advisory Council as contained in the Act ar to advise and consult with the South African Heritage Resources Agency on the protection of records forming part of the National Estate; to consult with the Public Protector on investigations into unauthorized destruction of records otherwise protected under the Act; and to submit a business plan annually to the Minister for his approval. The composition of the National Archives Advisory Council is determined by section 6 of the National Archives and Records Service of South Africa Act.",http://www.national.archives.gov.za/aboutnasa_content.html
The Australian Archive of Jewish Music,"The Australian Archive of Jewish Music (AAJM) is the only archive in the world concerned exclusively with sound, visual and bibliographic materials on the musical cultures of Jewish communities and individuals in Australia and South, East and Southeast Asia. The AAJM was established at Monash University in 1994 under the umbrella of MAMU. While there are Jewish music archives in various parts of the world, the unique quality of the AAJM is its focus on Australia and South, East and Southeast Asia. Collection-building, networking and research has thus far seen the accumulation of over 1000 vinyl discs (78rpm, 45rpm and 33 1/3rpm), hundreds of audio tapes (reel-to-reel and cassette), videotapes, CDs and DVDs, field recordings of interviews and performances, sheet music and scores, and a plethora of documents, nearly all of which fall within our geographic purview. The AAJM has also accepted donations of musical instruments. Most of our material has been donated or bequeathed by members of the Jewish and wider communities, the result being an eclectic mix of styles and genres, including Klezmer, folk, liturgical and paraliturgical music, Jewish popular and art music, popular and art music presented by Jewish performers, Chassidic music, Holocaust songs, and more. In 2002, the AAJM produced the compilation CD Ta’am as a means of presenting some examples from its sound collection to the general public. The songs and music chosen have an Ashkenazi slant (that is, of Central and East European heritage) and were all performed in Australia. Five years later, the AAJM compiled and produced another CD titled Out of Babylon, which contains mainly Judeo-Babylonian songs performed in Australia, Iraq, Israel, India Singapore Hong Kong and Shanghai. A collection of certain audio files are available online covering pre-1950 recordings of Hebrew and Yiddish songs and performance representative of Jewish music culture in Australia.",https://www.monash.edu/arts/music-archive/special-collections/australian-archive-of-jewish-music
The Max Hunter Collection,"The Max Hunter Collection is an archive of almost 1600 Ozark Mountain folk songs, recorded between 1956 and 1976. A traveling salesman from Springfield, Missouri, Hunter took his reel-to-reel tape recorder into the hills and backwoods of the Ozarks, preserving the heritage of the region by recording the songs and stories of many generations of Ozark history. As important as the songs themselves are the voices of the Missouri and Arkansas folks who shared their talents and recollections with Hunter. Designed to give increased public access to this unique and invaluable resource, this site is a joint project of the Missouri State University Department of Music and the Springfield-Greene County Library in Springfield, Missouri, where the permanent collection is housed. The materials on this website were digitized and transcribed from Max Hunter's original reel-to-reel tapes and typewritten lyrics between 1998 and 2001. The project was led by Dr. Michael F. Murray, with assistance from Kathy Murray (tune transcriptions) and Mark Bilyeu (lyric transcriptions) from the Missouri State University Department of Music.",https://maxhunter.missouristate.edu/

Along with the recordings, the Milken Archive has documented the history of Jewish music in America through more than 180 oral histories with composers, cantors, educators, and performers, and invested heavily in the creation of comprehensive essays and liner notes that examine the cultural and historical contexts in which this music has been created. The Milken Archive’s mission is threefold: (1) to preserve Jewish musical history for current and future generations; (2) to disseminate and provide access to that history to a broad audience; and (3) to support and encourage the development of research and educational materials that will foster a broader understanding of the artistic, historical, social, and cultural forces at play in the world of Jewish music.",https://www.milkenarchive.org/

hate5six,"This project stands for the redistribution of high-quality live music videos in as much of an anti-capitalist framework as realistically allowable. At its crux, music is the communication of ideas through rhythm and sound. The introduction of money into the equation invariably obscures that connection. In an era when the turnover rate in the community is staggeringly high, this site serves as a vehicle for preservation and posterity. Institutional memory is key in any setting, and hardcore is no exception. A band's live performance tells a story about a particular moment in time relative to a particular audience. The intention here is to share that story with people who could not be there to experience it, both physically and temporally, or with those who have no conception of what hardcore is. Without an audience, a band is just sending acoustic vibrations into an empty room. Without a band, bodies are just standing catatonically in a room waiting for inspiration or some other activation of the senses. This interface between the two defines an impassable gap between seeing a live show in the flesh and watching a two dimensional projection of said show on a screen. They can never be equivalent, but there are ways to construct a bridge that attempts to close that gap. The retelling of these narratives in this manner is the sole mission of hate5six.com.",https://hate5six.com/
Circulation Zero,"The beauty of digitization really sinks in at 30,000 feet. In-flight woes — that seat leaned to within an inch of your face, the unshowered over-sharer, the wailing toddler — all fade with Claude Bessy rants and Melanie Nissen pics in view. Several years ago, a collector comrade assembled a complete run of Slash magazine (with a little help from me) and had scanned every last newsprint page and had sent 'em my way (thanks, Jeff). That small kindness of sharing such a sizable effort would prove to be a turning point. While complete runs of fanzines like Touch & Go and We Got Power have been collected into awesome anthologies, many pioneering punk rags — the large format, newsprint ones in particular — are available only to dedicated collectors or packrats who've kept 'em since way back when. Not infrequently I've talked to fanzine creators and contributors who didn't even hang onto copies of their own publications. While assembling some sets is doable with some moxie and spending cash, several runs border on the impossible even if you've got the drive and dough to acquire 'em. Digital editions are the only way most people will encounter these punk rags of yesteryear. Circulation Zero is an experiment, my attempt to ""give back"" by parlaying the preservation of some beloved punk publications into a greater good. My hope is that the original creators will not only enjoy seeing their work resuscitated but will also appreciate the fact that their work is helping generate donations to worthy causes. The site is also an attempt to answer some questions that bounce around in my head. Are collections better off inside institutional libraries or in the hands of collectors? Should ancient in-fighting prevent bringing the punk print hey-day to a new generation? Should eggshell walking over copyright issues cock-block oldsters from taking a whirl on the wayback machine? Can a world chock full of entitled interweb denizens be trusted to donate even a pittance in exchange for a treasure trove of never-before-digitized fanzines? I don't know the answers but hopefully Circulation Zero will prove my hunches correct. Dig in!",https://www.circulationzero.com/

The Berkeley Folk Music Festival & the Folk Revival on the US West Coast—An Introduction,"Welcome to The Berkeley Folk Music Festival & the Folk Revival on the US West Coast—An Introduction, a digital exhibit that presents the story of the Berkeley Folk Music Festival, which took place on the campus of the University of California between 1958 and 1970. The Exhibit was curated from the Berkeley Folk Music Festival Archive, a repository of roughly 33,500 artifacts housed at Northwestern University Libraries and now fully digitized through a National Endowment for the Humanities Preservation and Access Grant. Much of the Berkeley Archive has never been seen or heard before publicly. Within the Exhibit, a narrative history points to the understudied significance of California and the West Coast in the larger story of the American folk music revival. It also shows how materials in the Berkeley Folk Music Festival Archive raise important questions about race, class, gender, region, higher education, public space, cultural heritage, and the practice of American democracy during the decades after World War II. The exhibit’s sections are navigable both through the “Exhibit” link located at the top menu and through buttons placed at the bottom of each page. Additionally, Scott Krafft, Curator of the Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections at Northwestern University Libraries, provides a Foreword that explains how the Berkeley Archive made its way from California to Evanston, Illinois.

The Dancehall Archive & Research Initiative,"With its seeds rooted in the early toast and talk over style credited to the first wave of Jamaican deejays of the 1950s, Jamaica’s dancehall has exploded outwards from its confined beginnings inside of Kingston’s inner-cities to become a global art form and a space of artistic and creative expression for more than three generations of youths from multiple backgrounds and cultures.  Spanning more than five decades and covering several generations from its early forms to the present, dancehall is the clear antecedent to music and cultural forms such as Rap music (Hip Hop) in the USA, Reggaeton (more appropriately Dancehallton) in Latin/South America, and seeded others like Afrobeat on the African continent and Tropical House in the Americas.  As the decades advance, the need to appropriately position dancehall in the global and international musical and cultural debates becomes more pressing. The Dancehall Archive and Research Initiative (“DHA”) is the brainchild of Professor Donna P. Hope and was conceptualised during her more than three and a half decades of participation in, and research and scholarship about, dancehall.  Its mission is to preserve and disseminate the knowledge and culture of dancehall for current and future generations across the world by facilitating and encouraging the pursuit of research and scholarship, art, culture around dancehall culture. The DHA is committed to unearthing and documenting all forms of  scholarship on dancehall and developing, maintaining and supporting intellectually challenging, creative and  innovative research and scholarship from all fields that simultaneously highlight and preserve the stellar achievements of dancehall as a global art form that resonates with individuals from multiple cultures, races and socioeconomic backgrounds. The DHA’s website – dancehallarchive.org – and its interconnected social media platforms, will provide information about seminal and ongoing dancehall works, as well as about our activities and projects, while acting as a resource for all who seek to know about, develop, build, preserve, and represent for dancehall culture globally.",http://www.dancehallarchive.org/
