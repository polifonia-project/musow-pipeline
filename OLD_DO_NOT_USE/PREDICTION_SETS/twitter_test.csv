"The Getty Digital Archive Expands to 135,000 Free Images: Download High Resolution Scans of Paintings, Sculptures, Photographs & Much Much More","J. Paul Getty was not a billionaire known for his generosity. But since his death, the Getty Trust and complex of Getty museums in L.A. have carried forth in a more magnanimous spirit, ostensibly adhering to values that transcend their founder: “service, philanthropy, teaching, and access.” A collection first gathered for private investment and consumption (sometimes under a cloud of scandal) has expanded into galleries that millions pass through every year; a Conservation Institute dedicated to preserving the world’s art; and a Research Institute proclaiming a social mission: a devotion to expanding “our knowledge of the history of art, of all countries, of all languages,” according to its director Thomas Gaehtgens, who also says, “a society without art cannot really survive.” Put another way, as one of the Getty’s art market competitors was once quoted as saying, “They just want people to like them.” He didn’t mean it as a compliment, but if you are an art lover—and not a billionaire art collector—you may genuinely appreciate this quality. And you may like them even more now that their open access digital collections have almost doubled to 135,000 high-resolution images since we last checked in with them five years ago.",https://www.openculture.com/?p=1059990

The Brig Digital Archive,"Brig is the University of Stirling's student newspaper. It celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2019, the first issue published on 3 October 1969. In April 2019 the University Archives was awarded a grant from the Stirling Fund to digitise and make available the first 25 years of the newspaper covering the years 1969-1994. This catalogue, produced by University of Stirling students as part of the Stirling Fund project, provides summary information for the contents of each newspaper from 1969-1987. To aid the searching of the collection detailed information is recorded in the description field for each page of each issue of the newspaper including keywords and names of individuals who feature in articles. The catalogue description for each issue provides access to a fully digitised version which can be viewed by clicking on the thumbnail image on the right hand side of the page. In the early years of the production of the newspaper a new volume was produced every academic year with issues running from September / October to May / June. The content and style of the paper changed over the years as each new editorial team brought new ideas and changes to the look, design and content of the newspaper. The contents of Brig over the twenty five years from 1969-1994 provide a detailed record of student life on the Stirling campus recording and reflecting on news and events (both local and international), culture and sport.",https://collections.stir.ac.uk/collections/getrecord/GB559_UA_D_2_1
STREAM HUNDREDS OF NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN AMERICAN MASTERS INTERVIEWS,"Interviews from Maya Angelou, Patti Smith, Betty White, David Bowie, Herbie Hancock, Mel Brooks and Carol Burnett are among the over 1,000 never-before-seen recordings held within the newly launched American Masters Digital Archive. Available to the public for the first time, the digital archive includes hours of footage, accompanied by searchable transcripts that synchronize the video to a viewer’s place within the text. “We’ve aired hundreds of carefully crafted programs that illuminate the stories of our cultural giants,” American Masters said. “But just a fraction of the interviews filmed for American Masters appear in the final films; nearly 96% of the footage never gets released.” To create the catalog, the American Masters team utilized the digitization of 2,156 tapes, excerpts of which have made it to the American Masters Podcast. The archive is searchable by keyword, with advanced options that allow interview-gold hopefuls to strike lucky within a more refined set of search criteria. The interviews are also cataloged by episode, which groups all of the recordings associated with a specific film. The documentary “Lena Horne: In Her Own Words,” for example, culls together an amazing lineup of interviews with Debbie Allen, Dionne Warwick and Horne herself, who alone clocks in over six hours of footage. Also worth a watch in its entirety is the catalog for “Lou Reed: Rock and Roll Heart,” which gathers Bowie, John Cale, Philip Glass, Nan Goldin and Jonas Mekas, among others. You can check out the project’s exhaustive listings here.",https://www.allarts.org/2021/01/american-masters-digital-archive-interviews/
How to Build a Digital Archive of Your Artwork,"It’s easy to always be focused on the future of your work as an artist. Katie Carey is a ceramic artist, writer, and strategist out of Denver, Colorado. She joined the Artwork Archive team after the platform transformed her own art practice. I, for one, am guilty of moving on from a current project without so much as even photographing the work before sending it off to its new home, and then I’m on to the next exciting project. However, it recently hit me that perhaps just as important as the physical work itself is the documentation of that work. I realized that, no matter how good the work might be, it will not live on if it's not documented well and archived securely. I always assumed that I would be making work indefinitely and would be capable of making similar work if I wanted to recreate an unphotographed work. It's all too easy to assume that the gallery sites that host photographs of installations of my work would still be around if sometime down the line I wanted to use them for my own portfolio. Instagram and other social media platforms give you a false sense of security that they will always be there to pull images from in the future. With my website on auto-pilot, I fell into a comfortable naivety that the internet is a permanent place of archival information. However, that’s far from the truth. Websites crash, updates render your images useless, hard drives fail, external drives get corrupted, water gets spilled on keyboards, and for me, personally, my hard drive got immediately fried when I plugged it into an outlet of an old Victorian house while on vacation. Right at that moment, all the things I wanted to apply to, or simply even remember in the future flashed before my eyes. How would I build back up an entire portfolio that was sold if I wanted to apply for a residency this summer? What if I wanted to go back to grad school and I didn’t have any work to show? What if, most simply—but also most deeply— I just wanted to look back over my artistic development in a few years and see the progression of my body of work? I decided then that if for whatever miracle, I could get the good people at Apple to recover my data, I would take a more active role in documenting and archiving my artworks. Thankfully, after many tears and a few different trips to the Apple store, I miraculously had my hard drive recovered and immediately began setting out on finding the most simple and also most secure way to digitally document my artwork. I figured that if I could put in 30 minutes of work upfront finding an art inventory system that works for me, I would save the month or so that I spent stressing out over whether or not they would be able to recover my data. I developed a simple system for myself that helps me to both archive and keep track of my artworks. Most surprising, however, I found that I actually started to enjoy the process of documenting my work. It allowed me to see my work in a new light, value my current projects, see my progress more clearly, and gain peace of mind in the direction of my art practice. I am now able to see the full scope of the last ten years of creating work and feel a type of satisfaction when looking through my inventory catalog. Moreover, it helps me stay organized in day-to-day life so that I don’t have to stress about the small things. I know where my artworks are located, who bought them, where they need to be in a month for a show, and when I need to invoice or follow up on an invoice. If you asked anyone I know, they would laugh if you told them that I enjoy any type of activity that includes getting organized. I’m the type of person that leaves old coffee mugs in my car and tried and failed the Marie Kondo method in the span of a week. My clothes remain in an angry lump on my couch instead of rolled neatly and happily in my drawers. But, my journey into documenting my artwork has stuck around—and I’m here to tell the tale. Let’s jump into what I learned along the way. Before you begin the process There are many different reasons to archive your artwork. Perhaps you want to make it easier to update your portfolio. Perhaps you want to be able to pull your updated resume, CV and press for an upcoming grant application at a moment’s notice. Maybe your portfolio has become outdated and you are searching for a way to keep it up-to-date in order to highlight your newest works and biggest achievements to date with potential collectors and clients. Perhaps you are looking for a secure way to digitally store your inventory of artworks and ensure your artistic legacy for years to come. Personally, my reason for starting a digital archive of my artwork was two-fold. I wanted a secure way to back up my artworks with all the details about them, their exhibition history, and all related sales information and images. It wasn’t enough for me to have them in GDrive or Excel (though this is a good start). I was looking for a way to build a full picture of the history of my artwork and be able to access that information as quickly as possible without digging through thousands of folders. The second reason turned out to be more of a comprehensive way for me to gain insights into my creative trajectory as an artist. I quickly saw how valuable it was to be able to organize my works and get a full picture of my art career from the start. I could see where certain creative evolutions took place, what types of artworks and themes sold the best, what geographical regions were the most profitable for my artwork. This information helped spark new strategic ideas for both the direction of my own art practice and the business aspect of my artwork. Whatever the reason, it’s important to define your “why” before you begin to help act as your guiding North Star as you go through the archiving process. Getting started: What information to start gathering If you are like most artists, you most likely have bits and pieces of this information all over the place. You have information on your website, at your galleries, in past publications, on your social media, and in your own records. This is what we are trying to solve, but it is also a great starting point. Take a look at your CV and use the exhibition history section as a jumping-off point. Then, create a running list of works that you want to inventory. Some artists choose to work chronologically from the most recent artworks, for example, as this information is the most top of mind. Here is the information that I started with for each artwork: Title of the artwork The date it was created The medium/mediums used Dimensions of the artwork The price of the artwork Any exhibitions that it was accepted into Any galleries in which the artwork showed If the artwork was sold and who it sold to The high-resolution image of the artwork Any detail images of the artwork From there I started to fill in more information once I got the framework in place. First steps: Choose the right tools to archive your work The tools you choose to archive your work will determine the scope of your archiving project. I decided to go with Artwork Archive as it was highly recommended by other artists, could capture the breadth of information I was looking to archive, was cloud-based, had neat “extras” like invoicing, a public profile option, and a range of professional pre-formatted reports–and on top of it all, it was the most affordable option. I started with all of the works I already had digital photos of, either on a website, on my phone, or professional photos. I started with my most recent work (mainly because I was still excited about them). Made a master desktop folder of all the images I had and, honestly, the rest was pretty straightforward. After uploading a bulk of my images, I then went back and recorded all the information like title, price, and medium alongside the image. Adding artworks to the database is easy. All the fields I filled in for medium, for example, were “remembered” so that I can now filter, sort, and search for those works within the database. It’s an incredible way to quickly pull up very specific pieces within a large body of work without remembering the exact name of the work. Or, if I want to create a price list for a customer that is interested only in porcelain works with blue and gold patterning, for example, I could quickly pull up all of my works that fit that category and within a few clicks generate a report for them with the thumbnails of those works along with all their information and prices. One of my favorite aspects of the platform is that the database is so visual—because, well, artists are very visual beings! I can easily scan all the works I have in my inventory or in certain galleries or retail locations. I don’t have to scan through loads of text or spreadsheets or click in and out of a pile of folders. Second step: Getting all the details right Beyond documenting my artworks, I was looking for an inventory program that could build a holistic picture of my archive with a dynamic database. What I mean by that is that I wanted to be able to tie artwork records to contacts, documents, exhibitions etc. instead of living statically in a list. Have you ever found yourself panicked in the middle of the night asking yourself: Did I already commit this painting to an exhibition in September? Have I submitted to this exhibition before? Who did I sell that painting to last year? How much did the frame cost? What gallery is performing best for me? What body of work of mine is the most profitable? What were the dimensions of the painting that is currently on loan? Will this group of artworks work together for as a solo show? I can now easily find the answers to all of these questions within a few seconds instead of fueling my insomnia with unanswered questions plaguing me. I got to this point by adding the following information into my archive after getting my artworks uploaded: The locations where my artworks have shown If some of your works are at a gallery or were at a gallery in the past, you can create a ‘Location’. When you assign an artwork to a location, you will start building a “location history” for that artwork, which helps with your catalog raisonne. I also like this feature for knowing when I need to pick my works back up from the gallery, what works sold from the gallery, and for creating quick consignment reports for the gallery. My art business contacts (collectors, gallerists, models, designers) Adding my contacts in help to easily keep track of the key people associated with my art business such as buyers and galleries. I, admittedly, am not great at following up with clients after an initial sale, but it’s so important. Your current client list is a huge source for potential sales. It’s essential, I’m learning, to have their contact information and some past notes about what they previously purchased available wherever and whenever I need to access it. Exhibitions I have entered If you enter or participate in a lot of exhibitions, it’s crucial to keep track of where your artwork is coming and where it is going at any time. “Exhibitions” is a way for you to track information that corresponds to each competition/exhibition you've entered. You can record information including Pieces Submitted, Submission Deadline, Pieces Accepted, Competition Date, Notification Date, and Awards. It’s been a useful tool for me to see what pieces are getting accepted regularly and make some conclusions about patterns I see. Any editioned artworks/prints of my original works Editioned work is a particularly sticky wicket to try and archive without a dedicated tool. There are too many details, too many moving parts, and just too much in general. I was thrilled to see that Artwork Archive built out a comprehensive way to track original editions and reproduction prints within the archive. Some of the financials Because I’m more interested in numbers than most artists, I love knowing where every dollar of my art business is coming in from and where every dollar is going. The “income” feature has been helping me get an accurate picture of the business side of things. You can tie your expense and revenue items to clients and get insights into your finances. Most importantly, make archiving part of your process Habits are established through repetition. Make archiving a part of your creative process and you will thank yourself in the long run. When you finish an artwork, add photographing the work and recording the artwork details in your archive to your final steps before you are truly finished and you post the final product to Instagram.Get your own archive set up You can sign up for a free 30-day trial of Artwork Archive to get your own archive started. There are plans for all levels of artists (my one regret: I wish I had started earlier!). Plans start at $6/month for 50 archived artworks. Another plus of the platform is that you can upload extremely high-resolution images (30mb) and up to 10 images per artwork record. The next level up allows for 500 archived artworks and the highest plan, the master account, is an unlimed plan.",https://www.artworkarchive.com/blog/how-to-build-a-digital-archive-of-your-artwork
"ACOR Photo Archive Project 2016-2020: Building a Valuable Resource for “a Diverse, International Community”","Achievements: reflections on four transformative years Initiated in 2016 and encompassing the indexing, digitization, description, and online publication of 31,000 photographs, the ACOR Research Library Photographic Archive Project represented a great leap forward in ACOR’s efforts to enhance our archives, reduce barriers to information, and promote international scholarship. Thanks to a Title VI program American Overseas Research Centers (AORC) grant from the U.S. Department of Education (2016–2020), ACOR has been able to make thousands of photos downloadable instantly from its open-access online platform. These images, along with their metadata, can be reused anywhere. Prior to this project, ACOR’s archival photographs lingered in the basement—undisturbed and uncataloged—for years, in formats that, in terms of modern library usage, were rapidly becoming inaccessible. Since the launch of the photo archive platform in 2017, these images have been in constant use by high-school and university students, professors, researchers, publishers, and prestigious institutions, such as the Smithsonian. In 2020, the photo archive processed its largest ever image request, providing an extraordinary 700 images to the Living Museum of Umm Qais project. ACOR’s archival materials have gone from being under threat of disintegration and all but out of reach to being digitally preserved and regularly accessed by over 6,500 distinct users each year. One of the most significant achievements of this project was the creation of an authority list that for the first time compiles all major transliterations and Arabic-script versions of more than two hundred prominent heritage site names in Jordan. This list, made open access for other projects to benefit from, incorporates internationally recognized standards—including the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, Library of Congress naming authorities, and local taxonomies (such as those of the Jordanian Department of Antiquities and Royal Geographic Society)—and thus provides previously disconnected data in one place. In order to encourage scholarship based on ACOR’s archival materials, an exhibition and fifteen photo essays were published on the project website to provide context about the collections, greatly exceeding the project goal of only ten essays. Some are interviews with distinguished archaeologists, among them Nancy Lapp and Bert de Vries. Others draw out themes from among the images, such as the feminist history of archaeology and community heritage. People beyond ACOR are following suit with their own such works. In 2019, Boston College’s undergraduate journal of Middle Eastern studies, Al Noor, published a photo essay of Jane Taylor photographs from Mada’in Al-Saleh in Saudi Arabia. Presentations designed to increase awareness of the photo archive have been given in the U.S. six times (including twice virtually), in Jordan eleven times, and twice in other international venues (London, Athens). Four video lectures, including one in Arabic, have been produced and shared widely online. These can be viewed on the ACOR YouTube channel. Once again, the project’s efforts far exceeded its stated goals, which were to give two U.S. and two international presentations. We are proud to have reached a much broader audience. Building an interconnected community of practice The ACOR Photo Archive was made possible through self-reflective collaboration. Although originally envisioned to solely make ACOR’s archival images available to academics and professionals, the project ended up interacting with a far broader audience. This was due to the variety of people who worked on the archive taking time to listen to what was important about the archive with respect to each other’s area of specialist knowledge and membership of different (potential user) communities. By listening to these insights, we were able to make decisions about the design of the online archive that would make it accessible to a range of international groups of differing education levels—from scholars to schoolchildren. Project archivists with master’s degrees in library and information studies (MLIS) and in digital humanities, museum studies, and the history of photography hailing from the U.S. and the UK worked together with Jordanian-Palestinian librarians and digitization technicians with in-depth archaeological knowledge of Jordan and the wider Middle East to produce an archive that was suited to the Jordanian context. The ACOR library and archival team sought to share the archival knowledge they themselves were gaining through the project at every stage. A newly initiated program of digitization internships brought students and graduates from around the region to participate. In Jordan, ACOR is one of the few institutions offering such training, which directly helps to advance the field in the country. Since 2017, ACOR has run workshops on archival methods that have been instrumental in building an archival community of practice in Jordan and the wider region. Attendance trebled in three years, with sixty-five gallery, library, archive, and museum professionals from eighteen institutions participating in 2019. As a result of these initiatives, ACOR has become a hub for capacity-building in archival skills. The photo archive team also sought to share lessons learned throughout the project by participating alongside peers and leaders in the field at the Council on Library and Information Resource’s Digital Library Forum 2019, as well as by bringing North American and international experts to Jordan. All of these collaborations matter because decisions taken at the metadata level inform how digital objects are presented to—and therefore are understood by—both local and international communities. In the postcolonial context of overseas research centers such as ACOR, this is a significant responsibility. Consequently, the photo archive that this multicultural team produced is “fit for purpose” for promoting understanding of Jordan and the region locally and far beyond. Arabic-language accessibility In the course of the project, the team became increasingly aware of the limitations of the original project scope with regards to the language that would make it possible to sift through the 31,000-photo archive to locate images of a particular place or topic. As in the world of print publication, the digital humanities landscape has been dominated by the English language. As a result, English-language scholarship often provides the default references. Translating the analog photographs to a digital existence on the open internet wasn’t enough to ensure sufficient access to the wide range of stories they had to tell. We needed to seize this opportunity of funded, focused efforts to literally translate the textual data they offer: the handwritten English-language notes of photographers and scholars that we were transcribing had to be translated into Arabic. We then needed to synthesize these notes in both languages into the mechanism for finding information online: search terms or keywords. Through efforts pioneered by ACOR library staff, this two-step translation process, which provides rich information in Arabic as well as English, was given its initial trial run through the Madaba photo series within the Rami Khouri collection. This had great results but took double the time to produce the metadata, even though the academic texts consulted for the captions were available in Arabic, a rarity for cultural heritage texts. The types of limitations we were encountering aren’t unique: digital humanities is an emerging field facing up to its inherited problems worldwide. However, as ACOR is a research center dedicated to supporting knowledge development within the postcolonial context of Jordan, it was vital for our team to deconstruct barriers blocking equitable access to archival material upon which further knowledge may be produced, whether in the form of academic scholarship or public history. Engagement In order to begin dismantling such structural inequalities, we built outreach and engagement into every activity. Making a resource open access isn’t enough—you need to actively encourage use, recontextualization, and reinterpretation of the images. Since the project’s launch in 2017, we have invited many different voices to interpret the archival records. When the first Jordan School Librarians Conference was held in 2018, we jumped at the chance to tell these vital conduits of knowledge about the resource ACOR offered for Jordan’s heritage, a subject that makes up a significant part of the middle- and high-school national curriculum. In turn, this engagement exposed us to the needs of these new user groups. We added a “citation template” section for each photo in order to clearly communicate how students could reuse photos with appropriate attribution. As children began to use the archive as a research tool, they benefited from our reliable information source for their school projects, such as on Petra, a UNESCO World Heritage site.",https://publications.acorjordan.org/2021/01/25/acor-photo-archive-project-2016-2020-building-a-valuable-resource-for-a-diverse-international-community/
Digital archive provides improved access to Temple-based research,"Over the past several years, Temple Libraries staff have been working to create TUScholarShare, a publicly available digital archive. TUScholarShare contains articles, preprints, postprints, conference presentations, theses, dissertations and more, produced by Temple faculty, students and staff. The material in TUScholarShare is open to anyone, giving it a broader reach than most academic scholarship, which typically can only be accessed by those at other colleges and universities with subscriptions to particular journals. In addition, TUScholarShare is indexed by major search engines like Google Scholar, which helps faculty reach more people with their work. “TUScholarShare makes it easy for faculty to get their research out to a wide audience,” said Annie Johnson, assistant director for open publishing initiatives and scholarly communications at Temple Libraries. “We help faculty take versions of their research articles and make them freely available to the public and on the web so that anyone around the world can read them.” “One of our goals is to increase global access to the cutting-edge scholarly research being done by Temple faculty,” she added. TUScholarShare includes research by other members of the Temple community as well: “We also want to publicize work that doesn’t necessarily get published or widely disseminated,” said Alicia Pucci, scholarly communications assistant at Temple Libraries. “We know that  undergraduates and graduate students are doing important research, too.” Included in the repository is research on an enormous range of subjects, such as the latest on COVID-19, reports produced by the Sheller Center for Social Justice, Temple’s recent HIV breakthrough on removing viral DNA from the human genome, and teaching and learning materials contributed by Temple faculty across all disciplines.

An added bonus is that using TUScholarShare can help faculty fulfill grant requirements. “A number of funding agencies now require faculty to make any articles that result from funded research freely available, so we can help facilitate that through TUScholarShare,” Johnson said. To maximize the digital archive’s user-friendliness, staff at Temple Libraries have created collections around specific topics, which could support multidisciplinary collaboration. If members of the Temple community are more aware of each other’s work, Johnson explained, then they might more easily collaborate and share resources. “For example, a faculty member at the Katz School might know about COVID-19 research being done by their medical school colleagues, but they might not know about complementary research being done by faculty in CST or CLA,” Johnson said. Avi Kaplan, professor of educational psychology in the College of Education and Human Development, was among the first faculty to deposit his scholarship to TUScholarShare. “Using open access repositories of academic work has contributed tremendously to the wide reach and impact of my scholarship, as well as to broadening my exposure to other scholars’ work,” he said.

spotify-playlist-archive,"Spotify's playlists are great. I like that they're updated once in a while - change is good! I don't like, however, that it's impossible to see older versions. How am I supposed to remember the name of that song I really liked? Apparently, I'm not alone: see here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.

The script determines which playlists to scrape by looking at the file names in playlists/registry. Files get regenerated as follows: a pretty version of each playlist gets dumped in playlists/pretty, new tracks are added to the files in playlists/cumulative, and a plaintext version of each playlist is written to playlists/plain. The plain version is sorted alphabetically, rather than by track number, so that it only changes when tracks are added or removed, making Git History a nice way to visualize how the playlist evolves over time.

FLORIDA STATE COLLEGE AT JACKSONVILLE DIGITAL ARCHIVE,"Welcome to the Florida State College at Jacksonville (FSCJ) Digital Archive. The Archive provides online access to a growing number of collections of publications, media, and images of historical, academic and cultural importance to the College, the city of Jacksonville, and the State of Florida. Unless otherwise indicated, these resources were produced and published by FSCJ’s talented students, faculty and staff since the founding of the College over five decades ago. This ever-evolving archive of digital resources, which already contains over 10,000 scans, is made possible through the dedicated efforts of the staff of the FSCJ Library and Learning Commons. For information about how you can help support this archive, please see our FAQ page. FSCJ, originally known as Florida Junior College, opened its doors in August of 1966 to the largest incoming class of any community college in the nation, which it housed on two temporary campuses set up in an old elementary school and an abandoned Naval housing. Since then the College has grown to encompass four campuses and three centers across Duval and Nassau Counties and made a name for itself in academics, arts and sports. Our hope is that this Archive will help the students, staff, and faculty of FSCJ as well as members of the local community learn more about the vital role the College has played in Jacksonville’s history.

The Haitian American Dream Timeline,"""History is the fruit of power, but power itself is never so transparent that its analysis becomes superfluous. The ultimate mark of power may be its invisibility; the ultimate challenge, the exposition of its roots."" - Silencing the Past, Michel-Rolph Trouillot The Haitian American Dream examines the events and the forgotten stories of Haitian immigrants in the United States. In so doing, it explains the reasons behind the different waves of Haitian migration, its ongoing impacts, and upheavals so that, as Michel-Rolph Trouillot states, the stories of “the actors who participate in the production of history or any of the sites where that production” transpired are told. Timeline created by Alexandra Cenatus, Ivanna Moreno, and Margarita Vargas-Betancourt in collaboration with the UF Mellon Intersections Group on Global Blackness and Latinx Identity . Intersections is organized by the UF Center for the Humanities and the Public Sphere in partnership with the George A. Smathers Libraries with support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation._",https://exhibits.uflib.ufl.edu/HaitianAmericanDream/

The Women's Liberation Music Archive,"This project documents and celebrates the wealth and diversity of the feminist music-making of the 1970s and 80s and demonstrates its importance in the political and social context of that era. As in other social movements and political struggles, cultural activism was a major part of the Women’s Liberation Movement that began in the late 1960s. In a great burgeoning of creativity, feminists fused artistic activities with politics to develop and express feminist ideas. Women’s music, film and theatre groups, art and theatre proliferated throughout the 1970s and 80s. Feminist bands, musicians and related projects are archived here in a collection of written and oral histories and memorabilia. This includes photographs, videos, recordings, gig lists, lyrics and musical scores, press clippings, flyers, posters, weblinks and manifestos that testify to the creativity of the Women’s Liberation Movement. If this is your first visit to the site we hope you will find it an interesting and useful resource – or, if you have visited before, that you will enjoy the way it has been developing since its launch on May the 1st, 2011. Information about bands, musicians and musical projects is gathered under names listed alphabetically on the A – Z pages above. The ‘search’ field will direct you to all pages featuring the object of your search. On the right-hand side of the blog posts page you will find a list of links to relevant websites about women’s ongoing music-making, feminist activism past and present, plus other archiving projects, enabling you to follow up information found in other pages. A huge ‘thank you!’ to everyone who has made the archive possible through generously contributing material to the archive. As can be seen, there is quite a lot of information on some musicians, bands and projects and little or none for others. If you can help the archive to grow and to fill the gaps please contact us.
